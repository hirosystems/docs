title: Test a Contract
---

# Execute a test suite

Clarinet provides a testing harness based on Deno that enables you to create automated unit tests or
pseudo-integration tests using Typescript.

```bash
$ clarinet test
```

When you use `clarinet contract new foo` to create a new contract, clarinet automatically creates 
a unit test file for this new contract, _tests/foo_test.ts_. Other files under the _tests/_ directory 
following the Deno test naming convention will also be included:

- named test.{ts, tsx, mts, js, mjs, jsx, cjs, cts},
- or ending with .test.{ts, tsx, mts, js, mjs, jsx, cjs, cts},
- or ending with \_test.{ts, tsx, mts, js, mjs, jsx, cjs, cts}

Within these tests, developers can simulate mining a block containing transactions using their contract,
and then examine the results of those transactions as well as the events generated by them.

See the [billboard example](examples/billboard/tests/billboard_test.ts) for sample unit tests.

_Note: If you see an error in VS Code on the imports in the generated test file(s), that says, 
"An import path cannot end with a '.ts' extension" (example below), 
installing the [Deno extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) will resolve this error._

#### Measure and increase code coverage

To help developers maximizing their test coverage, Clarinet can produce a `lcov` report, using the following option:

```bash
$ clarinet test --coverage
```

From there, developers can use the `lcov` tooling suite to produce HTML reports:

```bash
$ brew install lcov
$ genhtml coverage.lcov
$ open index.html
```
