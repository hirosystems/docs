## API rate limits

You can access all of Hiro's API services without an API key, but you are subject to rate limits of 50 RPM, per client IP. To build with higher rate limits, you can generate a free API key in the Hiro Platform that as a default is set to the free "starter" plan, and you can upgrade your account to a [higher tier](https://www.hiro.so/pricing) as needed:

| Tiers          | API RPM | Stacks L2 requests / month | Bitcoin L1 requests / month |
|:---------------|:--------|:---------------------------|:----------------------------|
| No API key     | 50      | n/a                        | n/a                         |
| Free / Starter | 900     | 150K                       | 50K                         |
| $99 / Build    | 9K      | 15M                        | 500K                        |
| $599 / Scale   | 18K     | 75M                        | 5M                          |
| Enterprise     | Custom  | Custom                     | Custom                      |

With a single API key, you gain access to Hiroâ€™s suite of API services that span Bitcoin and Stacks:

**Bitcoin L1 API services**

- [Ordinals API](/bitcoin/ordinals/api)
- [Runes API](/bitcoin/runes/api)

**Stacks L2 API services**

- [Stacks Blockchain API](/stacks/api)
- [Token Metadata API](/stacks/token-metadata-api)

These new rate limits help us ensure fair usage of Hiro APIs and provide the best possible service as our community of developers and applications grow.
