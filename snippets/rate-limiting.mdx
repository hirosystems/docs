## API rate limits

All Hiro API services require an API key, which you can access with your Hiro Platform account. The following rate-limits (in requests per minute, or RPM) are applicable for all [Hiro APIs](https://hiro.so/pricing) as of November 2023:

| Tiers          | API RPM | Stacks per Month | L1 per Month |
|:---------------|:--------|:-----------------|:-------------|
| Free / Starter | 900     | 150k             | 50k          |
| $99 / Build    | 9k      | 15M              | 500k         |
| $599 / Scale   | 18k     | 75M              | 5M           |
| Enterprise     | custom  | custom           | custom       |

With a single API key, you gain access to Hiroâ€™s suite of API services that span Bitcoin and Stacks:

**Bitcoin L1 API services**

- [Ordinals API](/bitcoin/ordinals/api)
- [Runes API](/bitcoin/runes/api)

**Stacks L2 API services**

- [Stacks Blockchain API](/stacks/api)
- [Token Metadata API](/stacks/token-metadata-api)

These new rate limits help us ensure fair usage of Hiro APIs and provide the best possible service as our community of developers and applications grow.
