### API rate limits

The following rate-limits (in requests per minute, or RPM) are applicable for all Hiro APIs as of [November 2023](https://www.hiro.so/blog/updated-rate-limits-for-hiro-apis):

| API key | Rate Limit                        |
|:--------|:----------------------------------|
| No      | 50 requests per minute (RPM) per client IP, for unauthenticated traffic |
| Yes     | 500 requests per minute (RPM), regardless of origin IP, with an authenticated API key |

These rate-limits apply to the entirety of API traffic, regardless of whether it's from one or all of these APIs:
- [Stacks Blockchain API](./api)
- [Token Metadata API](./token-metadata-api)
- [Ordinals API](/ordinals/api)

These new rate limits help us ensure fair usage of Hiro APIs and provide the best possible service as our community of developers and applications grow.
