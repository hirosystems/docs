title: Overview
description: The Ordinals API provides you with fast, reliable data for Bitcoin ordinals and BRC-20 tokens via an easy-to-use REST interface.
---

The Ordinals API is a service that helps you with the complete ingestion of ordinals inscription data. Using our endpoints, you can retrieve metadata for a particular inscription, trading activity, all inscriptions held by a particular address, and more.

The Ordinals API uses REST endpoints to allow for cached responses in order to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary requests. Start integrating ordinals and BRC-20 tokens into your app with one of the most reliable APIs on the market today.
