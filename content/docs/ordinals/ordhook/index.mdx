title: Overview
description: Ordhook enables you to build ordinals event streams, so you can create accurate, lightweight databases that gracefully handle Bitcoin forks and reorgs.

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

Ordhook is a reorg-aware indexer that automatically handles chain forks, so you donâ€™t need to waste time or resources reindexing your database yourself.

With a familiar event-driven framework, you can customize what ordinals data you index in order to create lightweight databases for faster query responses and a better user experience.
