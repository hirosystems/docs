title: get-tenure-info?
description: Fetch information about Stacks tenures in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature


```clarity
(get-tenure-info? prop-name block-height)
```

- Input: 
  - `prop-name`: A TenureInfoPropertyName
  - `block-height`: A uint representing the Stacks block height
- Output: `(optional buff) | (optional uint) | (optional principal)` depending on the property

## Why it matters

The `get-tenure-info?` function is essential for:

1. Accessing historical tenure data within smart contracts
2. Retrieving information about block miners and rewards
3. Accessing VRF seeds for randomness-based applications
4. Analyzing miner participation and spending patterns

## When to use it

Use `get-tenure-info?` when you need to:

- Access tenure-specific data like VRF seeds or miner addresses
- Verify tenure timestamps or burnchain information
- Analyze block rewards and miner spending patterns
- Implement logic that depends on historical tenure data

## Best Practices

- Always handle the `none` case, as it will be returned for non-existent or future blocks
- Be aware that block rewards are only available after maturity (101 blocks on mainnet)
- Consider the two-hour accuracy window when working with tenure timestamps
- Cache frequently accessed tenure information to optimize execution costs

## Practical Example: Checking Miner Spending

```clarity
(define-read-only (get-miner-spend-ratio (blockHeight uint)))
(let
  (
    (winnerSpend (get-tenure-info? miner-spend-winner blockHeight))
    (totalSpend (get-tenure-info? miner-spend-total blockHeight))
  )
  (match (tuple (winner winnerSpend) (total totalSpend))
    success (some (/ (get success "winner") (get success "total")))
    error none
  )
)
```

## Available Properties

- `burnchain-header-hash`: Returns the burnchain block header hash (buff 32)
- `miner-address`: Returns the tenure miner's principal
- `time`: Returns the tenure time as Unix epoch timestamp (uint)
- `vrf-seed`: Returns the VRF seed for the tenure (buff 32)
- `block-reward`: Returns the total block reward (uint)
- `miner-spend-total`: Returns total spent by all miners for this tenure (uint)
- `miner-spend-winner`: Returns amount spent by winning miner (uint)

## Common Pitfalls

1. Not accounting for block reward maturity period (101 blocks)
2. Relying on exact tenure times (accuracy window of two hours)
3. Not handling the `none` case for invalid or future block heights

## Related Functions

- `get-block-info?`: Used to get information about Stacks blocks
- `block-height`: Returns the current block height
- `burn-block-height`: Returns the current burn chain block height

## Conclusion

The `get-tenure-info?` function provides crucial access to historical tenure data in Clarity smart contracts. Introduced in Clarity 3, this function enables developers to access detailed information about past tenures, including miner participation, block rewards, and VRF seeds. When used properly, `get-tenure-info?` is a powerful tool for implementing sophisticated contract logic that depends on historical blockchain state.
