## Function Signature

```clarity
(print expr)
```

- Input: `A`
- Output: `A`

## Why it matters

The `print` function is crucial for:

1. Debugging and logging expressions during contract development.
2. Evaluating and returning the input expression.
3. Enhancing code readability and maintainability by providing a way to output intermediate values.

## When to use it

Use `print` when you need to:

- Debug and log expressions during contract development.
- Evaluate and return an input expression.
- Output intermediate values for better understanding of contract behavior.

## Best Practices

- Use `print` primarily for debugging and development purposes.
- Ensure that the expression passed to `print` is meaningful and necessary for debugging.
- Remove or comment out `print` statements in production code to avoid unnecessary output.

## Practical Example: Printing an Expression

Let's implement a function that prints the result of an addition operation:

```clarity
(define-read-only (add-and-print (a int) (b int))
  (print (+ a b))
)

;; Usage
(add-and-print 3 4) ;; Prints 7 and returns 7
(add-and-print 10 20) ;; Prints 30 and returns 30
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `print` to output the result of an addition operation.
2. Implementing a public function to handle the addition and printing.
3. Handling both small and large input values.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `print` excessively, leading to cluttered output and reduced readability.
2. Assuming `print` is necessary for all expressions, leading to overuse.
3. Not removing or commenting out `print` statements in production code, resulting in unnecessary output.

## Related Functions

- `+`: Adds two or more numbers.
- `-`: Subtracts one number from another.
- `*`: Multiplies two or more numbers.
- `/`: Divides one number by another.

## Conclusion

The `print` function is a fundamental tool for debugging and logging expressions in Clarity smart contracts. It allows you to evaluate and return input expressions, providing a way to output intermediate values for better understanding of contract behavior. When used effectively, `print` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to debug and log expressions.
