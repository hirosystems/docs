description: Define public read-only functions in Clarity smart contracts.

## Function Signature

```clarity
(define-read-only (function-name (arg-name-0 arg-type-0) ...) function-body)
```

- Input: 
  - `function-name`: The name of the read-only function
  - `arg-name-N`: The name of each argument
  - `arg-type-N`: The type of each argument
  - `function-body`: The code to be executed when the function is called
- Output: Not applicable (definition statement)

## Why it matters

The `define-read-only` function is crucial for:

1. Creating public functions that can query contract state without modifying it.
2. Enabling efficient and gas-optimized read operations on the contract.
3. Implementing view functions that other contracts or off-chain applications can call.
4. Providing a safe way to expose contract data without risking state changes.

## When to use it

Use `define-read-only` when you need to:

- Create functions that return contract state or computed values.
- Implement getter functions for contract variables or complex data structures.
- Provide public interfaces for querying contract data without modifying state.
- Create helper functions that other contracts can call without incurring state change costs.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for read-only functions to clearly indicate their purpose.
- Ensure that read-only functions do not attempt to modify contract state.
- Utilize read-only functions for complex calculations that don't require state changes.
- Consider using read-only functions in combination with public functions to separate read and write operations.

## Practical Example: Token Balance Checker

Let's implement a read-only function for checking token balances:

```clarity
(define-map Balances principal uint)

(define-read-only (get-balance (account principal))
  (default-to u0 (map-get? Balances account))
)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `define-read-only` to create functions for querying token balances.
2. Implementing a getter function for individual account balances.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Attempting to modify contract state within a read-only function, which will cause an error.
2. Overusing read-only functions for complex calculations that might be better suited for off-chain computation.
3. Forgetting that read-only functions can still consume gas when called, even though they don't modify state.

## Related Functions

- `define-public`: Used to define public functions that can modify contract state.
- `define-private`: Used to define private functions that can only be called within the contract.
- `map-get?`: Often used within read-only functions to retrieve data from maps.

## Conclusion

The `define-read-only` function is an essential tool for creating efficient and safe query interfaces in Clarity smart contracts. By providing a way to expose contract data and perform calculations without modifying state, read-only functions enable you to create more transparent and gas-efficient contracts. When used effectively, this function can significantly enhance the usability and accessibility of smart contract data for both on-chain and off-chain applications.
