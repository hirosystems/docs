title: bit-shift-left
description: Use the bit-shift-left function for bitwise left shift operations in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(bit-shift-left i1 shamt)
```

- Input: 
  - `i1`: An integer (`int` or `uint`)
  - `shamt`: A `uint` representing the number of places to shift
- Output: An integer of the same type as `i1` (`int` or `uint`)

## Why it matters

The `bit-shift-left` function is crucial for:

1. Implementing certain bitwise algorithms and data structures.
2. Manipulating binary data at the bit level.
3. Creating bitmasks for various purposes.
4. Low-level optimizations in specific scenarios.

## When to use it

Use the `bit-shift-left` function when you need to:

- Implement certain cryptographic or hashing algorithms.
- Perform low-level data manipulations involving binary operations.
- Create specific bit patterns or masks.
- Optimize certain bitwise operations.

## Best Practices

- Remember that shifting beyond the bit width of the integer (128 bits in Clarity) will result in zero.
- Use `uint` for `shamt` to avoid potential issues with negative shift amounts.
- Be aware of the potential for overflow when shifting left, especially with large numbers or shift amounts.
- For multiplication by powers of 2, use the `pow` function instead, as it provides built-in overflow protection.

## Practical Example: Flag Management

Let's implement a simple flag management system using `bit-shift-left`:

```clarity
(define-constant FLAG_READ u1)
(define-constant FLAG_WRITE u2)
(define-constant FLAG_EXECUTE u4)

(define-read-only (create-flag (flagPosition uint))
  (bit-shift-left u1 flagPosition)
)

(define-read-only (set-flag (currentFlags uint) (flag uint))
  (bit-or currentFlags flag)
)

(define-read-only (check-flag (flags uint) (flag uint))
  (is-eq (bit-and flags flag) flag)
)

;; Usage
(set-flag (bit-or FLAG_READ FLAG_WRITE) FLAG_EXECUTE) ;; Returns u7 (READ | WRITE | EXECUTE)
(check-flag u7 FLAG_WRITE) ;; Returns true
(check-flag u7 (create-flag u3)) ;; Returns false
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `bit-shift-left` to create individual flags.
2. Combining `bit-shift-left` with `bit-or` to set flags.
3. Using `bit-and` to check if a specific flag is set.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `bit-shift-left` for multiplication without considering overflow risks.
2. Not considering the modulo behavior when shifting by amounts greater than or equal to 128.
3. Using a negative or non-uint value for the shift amount, which is not allowed.

## Related Functions

- `bit-shift-right`: Used for right-shifting bits.
- `bit-and`: Often used in combination with `bit-shift-left` for masking operations.
- `bit-or`: Used for combining flags or masks created with `bit-shift-left`.
- `pow`: Preferred for safe multiplication by powers of 2.

## Conclusion

The `bit-shift-left` function is a powerful tool for bitwise operations in Clarity smart contracts. This function is essential for creating bitmasks, implementing various bitwise algorithms, and performing low-level optimizations. However, you should be cautious about potential overflows and avoid using it for general multiplication tasks, where the `pow` function is more appropriate due to its built-in overflow protection.
