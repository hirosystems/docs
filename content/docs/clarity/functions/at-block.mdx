title: at-block
description: Use the at-block function to evaluate expressions at a specific block in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(at-block id-block-hash expr)
```


- Input: 
  - `id-block-hash`: A 32-byte buffer representing a block hash
  - `expr`: An expression to be evaluated
- Output: The result of evaluating `expr`

## Why it matters

The `at-block` function is crucial for:

1. Accessing historical contract state at a specific block.
2. Implementing time-dependent logic based on blockchain state.
3. Verifying past conditions or values in the contract.
4. Creating mechanisms that depend on specific blockchain checkpoints.

## When to use it

Use the `at-block` function when you need to:

- Evaluate contract state or expressions as they were at a specific past block.
- Implement logic that depends on historical blockchain data.
- Verify past conditions without relying on stored state.
- Create time-locked or checkpoint-based features in your contract.

## Best Practices

- Only use `at-block` when historical data is necessary, as it can be computationally expensive.
- Ensure the block hash used is from the `id-header-hash` property, not `header-hash`.
- Use read-only expressions within `at-block` to maintain determinism.
- Be aware of the potential for chain reorganizations when using recent block hashes.

## Practical Example: Historical Price Check

Let's implement a simple function that checks if a price was above a certain threshold at a specific block:

```clarity
(define-map AssetPrices uint uint)

(define-public (set-price (price uint))
  (ok (map-set AssetPrices block-height price))
)

(define-read-only (was-price-above-at-block (threshold uint) (blockHash (buff 32)))
  (at-block blockHash
    (let
      (
        (pastPrice (default-to u0 (map-get? AssetPrices block-height)))
      )
      (> pastPrice threshold)
    )
  )
)

;; Usage
(set-price u100)
;; ... several blocks later
(was-price-above-at-block u50 0x123456...) ;; Returns true if the price was above 50 at the specified block
```


This example demonstrates:
1. Using `at-block` to evaluate a condition based on historical data.
2. Combining `at-block` with map lookups to access past state.
3. Implementing a read-only function that depends on blockchain history.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `header-hash` instead of `id-header-hash`, which can lead to inconsistencies across forks.
2. Attempting to modify state within an `at-block` expression, which is not allowed.
3. Overusing `at-block`, which can lead to performance issues due to the cost of historical lookups.

## Related Functions

- `get-block-info?`: Used to retrieve information about specific blocks.
- `block-height`: Often used in conjunction with `at-block` for time-based logic.
- `id-header-hash`: Provides the correct hash to use with `at-block`.

## Conclusion

The `at-block` function is a powerful tool for implementing history-dependent logic in Clarity smart contracts. By allowing contracts to evaluate expressions as they would have at a specific past block, it enables sophisticated time-based mechanisms and historical verifications. However, this function should be used judiciously due to its potential performance impact and the complexities of working with blockchain history.
