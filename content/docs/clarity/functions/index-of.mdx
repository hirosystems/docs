title: index-of
description: Find the index of an element in a list in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(index-of list element)
```

- Input: 
  - `list`: A list of elements
  - `element`: The element to find in the list
- Output: `(optional uint)`

## Why it matters

The `index-of` function is crucial for:

1. Locating the position of an element within a list.
2. Implementing search functionality in smart contracts.
3. Enabling conditional logic based on the presence and position of elements.
4. Simplifying list operations by providing a built-in search mechanism.

## When to use it

Use `index-of` when you need to:

- Determine the position of an element in a list.
- Check if an element exists in a list and retrieve its index.
- Implement logic that depends on the order or position of elements.
- Simplify list search operations without writing custom loops.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the list and element types are compatible.
- Handle the `none` case when the element is not found in the list.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Consider the performance implications when searching large lists.

## Practical Example: Finding an Element in a List

Let's implement a function that finds the index of a given element in a list of integers:

```clarity
(define-read-only (find-index (element int) (numbers (list 10 int)))
  (index-of numbers element)
)

;; Usage
(find-index 3 (list 1 2 3 4 5)) ;; Returns (some u2)
(find-index 6 (list 1 2 3 4 5)) ;; Returns none
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `index-of` to find the position of an element in a list.
2. Handling both the case where the element is found and where it is not found.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming the element will always be found, leading to unhandled `none` cases.
2. Using `index-of` on lists with incompatible element types.
3. Overlooking the performance impact of searching very large lists.
4. Not considering that `index-of` returns a 0-based index.

## Related Functions

- `filter`: Used to create a new list containing only elements that match a condition.
- `map`: Applies a function to each element in a list, transforming the elements.
- `len`: Returns the length of a list.

## Conclusion

The `index-of` function is a powerful tool for locating elements within lists in Clarity smart contracts. It provides a straightforward way to search for elements and retrieve their positions, enabling more complex list operations and conditional logic. When used effectively, `index-of` simplifies list search operations and enhances the readability and maintainability of your smart contract code.
