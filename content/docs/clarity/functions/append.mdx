title: append
description: Use the append function to add elements to lists in Clarity smart contracts, with considerations for maximum list length.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(append (list A) A)
```

- Input: A list of type A, and a single element of type A
- Output: A new list of type A with the element appended

## Why it matters

The `append` function is crucial for:

1. Dynamically growing lists within smart contracts.
2. Adding new elements to existing data structures.
3. Implementing queue-like behaviors in contract logic.
4. Constructing lists incrementally during contract execution.

## When to use it

Use the `append` function when you need to:

- Add a new element to the end of an existing list.
- Construct a list by adding elements one at a time.
- Implement data structures that require adding elements in order.
- Combine existing lists with single elements.

## Best Practices

- Always use `as-max-len?` before appending to ensure the list doesn't exceed its maximum length.
- Be mindful of the maximum list length specified when defining the list.
- Consider using `concat` for joining two lists instead of repeatedly using `append`.
- Remember that `append` creates a new list; it doesn't modify the original list in-place.
- Use type-appropriate elements that match the list's declared type.

## Practical Example: Event Log with Max Length Check

Let's implement a simple event log system using `append` with a maximum length check:

```clarity
(define-data-var eventLog (list 50 (string-ascii 50)) (list))

(define-public (log-event (event (string-ascii 50)))
  (let
    (
      (current-log (var-get eventLog))
    )
    (match (as-max-len? (append current-log event) u2) success
      (ok (var-set eventLog success))
      (err u1)
    )
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-eventLog)
  (ok (var-get eventLog))
)

;; Usage
(log-event "Contract initialized")
(log-event "User registered")
(get-eventLog) ;; Returns (ok ("Contract initialized" "User registered"))
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `append` to add new events to an existing log.
2. Using `as-max-len?` to check if appending would exceed the maximum list length.
3. Handling the case where the list would exceed its maximum length.
4. Combining `append` with other Clarity functions like `var-set` and `var-get`.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting to use `as-max-len?` when appending to a list with a maximum length.
2. Attempting to append an element of the wrong type to a typed list.
3. Assuming `append` will always succeed without checking the list's current length.
4. Inefficiently using `append` in a loop when `concat` might be more appropriate.

## Related Functions

- `as-max-len?`: Used to check if a sequence exceeds a maximum length.
- `concat`: Used for joining two lists together.
- `list`: Used for creating new lists.
- `len`: Used for getting the current length of a list.

## Conclusion

The `append` function is a powerful tool for manipulating lists in Clarity smart contracts. By understanding its behavior, limitations, and the necessity of using `as-max-len?` with lists that have a maximum length, you can effectively manage dynamic data structures within your contracts. This enables more flexible and responsive smart contract designs while maintaining safeguards against exceeding predefined list size limits.
