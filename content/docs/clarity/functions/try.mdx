description: Handle errors in Clarity smart contracts using the `try!` function.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(try! expression)
```

- Input: `expression` (of type `(response T E)`)
- Output: `T` (if the response is `ok`) or causes a runtime error (if the response is `err`)

## Why it matters

The `try!` function is crucial for:

1. Simplifying error handling in Clarity smart contracts.
2. Implementing logic that requires automatic error propagation.
3. Ensuring data integrity by validating operations and handling errors gracefully.
4. Simplifying the process of handling responses in smart contracts.

## When to use it

Use `try!` when you need to:

- Simplify error handling in your smart contract.
- Implement logic that requires automatic error propagation.
- Validate operations and handle errors gracefully.
- Handle responses in your smart contract.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the expression returns a response type `(response T E)`.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other error handling functions for comprehensive error management.
- Handle the possible error cases to ensure robust contract behavior.

## Practical Example: Handling Errors in a Transfer Function

Let's implement a function that transfers STX and handles errors using `try!`:

```clarity
(define-public (transfer-stx (amount uint) (recipient principal))
  (begin
    (try! (stx-transfer? amount tx-sender recipient))
    (ok true)
  )
)

;; Usage
(transfer-stx u60 'SZ2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKQ9H6DPR) 
;; Returns (ok true) if successful
(transfer-stx u50 'SZ2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKQ9H6DPR) 
;; Returns (err u1) if the sender does not have enough balance
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `try!` to handle errors in a STX transfer operation.
2. Implementing a public function to handle the transfer and error propagation.
3. Handling both successful and error cases.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `try!` with expressions that do not return a response type, causing runtime errors.
2. Assuming the operation will always succeed, leading to unhandled error cases.
3. Not handling all possible conditions, resulting in incomplete error management.
4. Overlooking the need for proper error handling and validation.

## Related Functions

- `unwrap!`: Unwraps an optional value, causing a runtime error if the value is `none`.
- `asserts!`: Asserts a condition, causing a runtime error if the condition is false.
- `is-err`: Checks if a response is an error.

## Conclusion

The `try!` function is a fundamental tool for handling errors in Clarity smart contracts. It allows you to simplify error handling, ensuring data integrity and automatic error propagation. When used effectively, `try!` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to handle responses and errors.
