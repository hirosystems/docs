title: contract-of
description: Retrieve the principal of a contract implementing a trait in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(contract-of <trait-reference>)
```

- Input: A trait reference
- Output: The principal of the contract implementing the trait

## Why it matters

The `contract-of` function is crucial for:

1. Retrieving the principal (address) of a contract implementing a specific trait.
2. Enabling dynamic interactions with contracts based on traits.
3. Implementing contract-agnostic functions that work with any contract adhering to a specific interface.
4. Enhancing interoperability between contracts in a composable ecosystem.

## When to use it

Use the `contract-of` function when you need to:

- Get the actual contract address from a trait reference.
- Perform operations that require the contract's principal, such as authorization checks.
- Implement functions that can work with multiple contracts implementing the same trait.
- Debug or log information about which contract is being interacted with.
- Manage routing logic between different versions of contracts for upgradeable smart contracts.
- Implement access control mechanisms to restrict function calls to designated contracts.

## Best Practices

- Use `contract-of` in combination with traits to create more flexible and composable smart contracts.
- Remember that `contract-of` returns a principal, which can be used in other Clarity functions expecting a contract address.
- Consider using `contract-of` when implementing proxy or router contracts that work with multiple similar contracts.
- Be aware that `contract-of` can only be used with trait references, not with direct contract references.

## Practical Example: Modular Approach to Extension Contracts

Let's implement a system where specific functions can only be called by designated extension contracts:

### Define the Extension Trait

First, define a trait for the extension contract:

```clarity
(define-trait extension-trait
	(
		(callback (principal (buff 34)) (response bool uint))
	)
)
```

### Implement the Main Contract

Next, implement the main contract with the `request-extension-callback` function:

```clarity
(use-trait extensionTrait .extension-trait.extension-trait)
(define-map Extensions principal bool)

(define-public (set-extension (extension principal) (enabled bool))
  (ok (map-set Extensions extension enabled))
)

(define-public (request-extension-callback (extension <extensionTrait>) (memo (buff 34)))
  (let
    (
      (sender tx-sender)
    )
    (asserts! (and (is-extension contract-caller) (is-eq contract-caller (contract-of extension))) (err u1))
    (as-contract (contract-call? extension callback sender memo))
  )
)

(define-read-only (is-extension (extension principal))
  (default-to false (map-get? Extensions extension))
)
```

### Explanation

1. **Define the Extension Trait**: The `extensionTrait` defines a `callback` function that the extension contract must implement.
2. **Data Map for Valid Extensions**: `Extensions` is a map that stores the status (enabled/disabled) of extension contracts.
3. **Public Function `set-extension`**: This function allows adding or removing an extension contract from the `Extensions` map.
4. **Public Function `request-extension-callback`**: This function:
   - Retrieves the principal of the extension contract using `contract-of`.
   - Asserts that the caller is a valid extension and matches the extension principal.
   - Calls the `callback` function on the extension contract using `contract-call?`.
5. **Read-Only Function `is-extension`**: This function checks if a given contract principal is in the `Extensions` map and is enabled.

### Usage

1. **Set an Extension**:
   ```clarity
   (set-extension 'SP2J4ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6ZQ6 true)
   ```

2. **Request Extension Callback**:
   ```clarity
   (request-extension-callback .extension-contract (buff 34 "example memo"))
   ```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `contract-of` to get the principal of the extension contract implementing the extension trait.
2. Implementing a read-only function to check if the caller is a valid extension.
3. Restricting access to certain functions based on the authorized extension contracts.
4. Allowing the authorized extension contracts to call specific functions.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Attempting to use `contract-of` with a direct contract reference instead of a trait reference.
2. Forgetting that `contract-of` returns a principal, not a contract reference itself.
3. Not handling potential errors when working with trait references that might not be properly initialized.

## Related Functions

- `use-trait`: Used to define trait references that can be used with `contract-of`.
- `contract-call?`: Often used in combination with `contract-of` to call functions on the retrieved contract.
- `is-eq`: Can be used to compare the returned principal with known contract addresses.

## Conclusion

The `contract-of` function is a powerful tool for creating flexible and interoperable smart contracts in Clarity. By allowing contracts to dynamically retrieve the principal of trait-implementing contracts, this function enables the creation of more generic and reusable code. When used effectively, `contract-of` can significantly enhance the composability and modularity of your smart contract ecosystem, especially in scenarios like access control management where restricting function calls to designated contracts is essential.
