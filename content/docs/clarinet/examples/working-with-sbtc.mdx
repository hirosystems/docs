To take advantage of these features, make sure to use Clarinet 2.15.0 or later.

## About sBTC

sBTC is a fungible token on the Stacks blockchain. It follows the
[SIP-010 standard](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-010/sip-010-fungible-token-standard.md)
for fungible tokens.

Even though it's *just* a fungible token, Clarinet has some helpers to make it easier to work with.

## Using sBTC in your contract

To use sBTC in your contract, you need to add the `sbtc-deposit` smart contract to your requirements.

In a Clarinet project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ clarinet requirements add SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-deposit
```

This will add the [`sbtc-deposit`](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-deposit)
smart contract to your project, along with it's dependencies:
- [`sbtc-token`](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token)
- [`sbtc-registry`](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-registry)

When Clarinet detects the `sbtc-deposit` contract, it will automatically fund your test wallets with 
sBTC that you can use to test your contract in Clarinet simnet and devnet.

## Using sBTC in your contract

As a SIP-010 token, sBTC let you call the `transfer` function to transfer tokens from one address to another.

Let's say we have an NFT contract that allows users to mint an NFT by spending sBTC.  


```clarity
;; this code is for demo purposes
;; it doesn't implement SIP-009 NFT standard
(define-non-fungible-token nft-name uint)

;; mint for 100 sats
(define-data-var sats-sbtc-mint-price uint u100)
(define-data-var next-id uint u0)

(define-public (mint-one-with-sbtc)
  (begin
    ;; call the sbtc-token contract to transfer the sbtcs
    (try! (contract-call? 'SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token transfer
      (var-get sats-sbtc-mint-price)
      tx-sender
      (as-contract tx-sender)
      none
    ))

    (try! (nft-mint? nft-name (var-get next-id) tx-sender))

    (ok (var-set next-id (+ (var-get next-id) u1)))
  )
)
```

Because Clarinet already took care of funding the test wallets with sBTC, you can call the
`mint-one-with-sbtc` function with one of your test wallets.

In simnet (unit tests or `clarinet console`), the deployer address of the contract will remain
`SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4`, but in devnet, like every other requirements, the contract will
be deployed by the default deployer address. You don't have to worry about thisâ€”Clarinet always make
sure that your contracts call the right address.

## Deploying your contract on testnet

On testnet, the official Hiro sBTC contract is
[ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-token](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-token?chain=testnet).
This is the contract that is linked to the sBTC faucet: `ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-deposit`.

Again, Clarinet will make sure that your contracts call this address when being deployed on mainnet.
You can see the address of the sbtc-contract being re-mapped in the testnet deployment plan.

## Deploying your contract on mainnet

On mainnet, your contract will remain unchanged and call the one and only sBTC contract.
