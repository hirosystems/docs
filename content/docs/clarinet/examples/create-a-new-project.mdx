description: Once you install Clarinet, you can use Clarinet to create a new project.

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

Create a new Clarinet project with the basic directory structure and configuration files:

```terminal
$ clarinet new my-project
[32mCreate directory[0m [1mmy-project[0m
[32mCreate directory[0m [1mcontracts[0m
[32mCreate directory[0m [1msettings[0m
[32mCreate directory[0m [1mtests[0m

[32mCreate file[0m [1mtsconfig.json[0m
[32mCreate file[0m [1mvitest.config.js[0m
```
This will create a project directory with the following directory layout:

<Files className='pointer-events-none'>
  <Folder name="contracts" />
  <Folder name="settings" defaultOpen>
    <File name="Devnet.toml" />
    <File name="Mainnet.toml" />
    <File name="Testnet.toml" />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="tests" />
  <File name=".gitignore" />
  <File name="Clarinet.toml" />
  <File name="package.json" />
  <File name="tsconfig.json" />
  <File name="vitest.config.js" />
</Files>

The _txt`Clarinet.toml`_ file contains configuration for the smart contracts in your project. When you create contracts in your project, Clarinet will automatically add them to this file.

The _txt`settings/Devnet.toml`_ file contains configuration for accounts in the Clarinet console, including the seed phrases and initial balances for a set of out-of-the-box wallets that you can use for testing in the devnet environment.
