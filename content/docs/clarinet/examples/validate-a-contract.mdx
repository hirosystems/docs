title: Validate a contract
description: Clarinet provides syntax and semantics checkers for the smart contract language Clarity.
---

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

Validate the syntax and semantics of your contracts:

```terminal
$ clarinet check
[32mâœ”[0m [1m1 contract checked[0m
$ clarinet check path/to/my-contract.clar
[32mâœ”[0m [1m1 contract checked[0m
```

This command uses the _txt`Clarinet.toml`_ file to locate and analyze all the contracts in the project. If the Clarity code is valid, the command will indicate success with the response below.

<Callout title="Note">
The _console`clarinet check`_ command may also report warnings indicating the code is valid.
