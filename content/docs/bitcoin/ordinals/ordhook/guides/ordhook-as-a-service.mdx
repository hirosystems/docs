In order to build out a more robust and secure web app, you can run Chainhook as a service to stream your events continously to a server you designate.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. Configure an existing Bitcoin node to work with Ordhook.
2. Generate a Ordhook predicate to target specific transactions.
3. Scan the Bitcoin blockchain for transactions that match your predicate.
4. Initiate a Ordhook service to watch for matching transactions.
5. Dynamically register your predicate with Ordhook.

---

### Prerequisites

A fully synced Bitcoin node is required to run Ordhook as a service. Check out our guide on [How to sync a Bitcoin node](/guides/sync-a-bitcoin-node) before proceeding.

---

### Configure Ordhook

In this section, you will configure Ordhook to match the network configurations with the bitcoin config file. First, [install the latest version of Ordhook](/bitcoin/ordinals/ordhook/installation).

Next, you will generate a `Ordhook.toml` file to connect Ordhook with your bitcoind node. Navigate to the directory where you want to generate the `Ordhook.toml` file and use the following command in your terminal:

```console
ordhook config generate --mainnet
```

Several network parameters in the generated `Ordhook.toml` configuration file need to match those in the `bitcoin.conf` file created earlier in the [setting up a Bitcoin node](#setting-up-a-bitcoin-node) section. Please update the following parameters accordingly:

1. Update `bitcoind_rpc_username` with the username set for `rpcuser` in `bitcoin.conf`.
2. Update `bitcoind_rpc_password` with the password set for `rpcpassword` in `bitcoin.conf`.
3. Update `bitcoind_rpc_url` with the same host and port used for `rpcport` in `bitcoin.conf`.

Additionally, if you want to receive events from the configured Bitcoin node, substitute `stacks_node_rpc_url` with `bitcoind_zmq_url`, as follows:

```toml
[storage]
working_dir = "ordhook"

# The http API allows you to register / deregister predicates dynamically.
# This is disabled by default.
#
# [http_api]
# http_port = 20456
# database_uri = "redis://localhost:6379/"

[network]
mode = "mainnet"
bitcoind_rpc_url = "http://0.0.0.0:8332"
bitcoind_rpc_username = "devnet"
bitcoind_rpc_password = "devnet"
# Bitcoin block events can be received by Chainhook
# either through a Bitcoin node's ZeroMQ interface,
# or through the Stacks node. Zmq is being
# used by default:
bitcoind_zmq_url = "tcp://0.0.0.0:18543"
# but stacks can also be used:
# stacks_node_rpc_url = "http://0.0.0.0:20443"

[limits]
max_number_of_bitcoin_predicates = 100
max_number_of_concurrent_bitcoin_scans = 100
max_number_of_processing_threads = 16
bitcoin_concurrent_http_requests_max = 16
max_caching_memory_size_mb = 32000

# Disable the following section if the state
# must be built locally
[bootstrap]
download_url = "https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/ordhook/mainnet-ordhook-sqlite-latest"

[logs]
ordinals_internals = true
chainhook_internals = true
```

Here is a table of the relevant parameters this guide changes in our configuration files.

| bitcoin.conf    | Ordhook.toml          |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| rpcuser         | bitcoind_rpc_username |
| rpcpassword     | bitcoind_rpc_password |
| rpcport         | bitcoind_rpc_url      |
| zmqpubhashblock | bitcoind_zmq_url      |

## Initiate Ordhook service

In this section, you'll learn how to run Ordhook as a service using the [Ordhook SDK](https://github.com/hirosystems/ordhook/tree/develop/components/ordhook-sdk-js) to post events to a server.

Use the following command to start the Ordhook service for streaming and processing new blocks appended to the Bitcoin blockchain:

`ordhook service start --post-to=http://localhost:3000/api/events --config-path=./Ordhook.toml`

When the Ordhook service starts, it is initiated in the background to augment the blocks from Bitcoin. Bitcoind sends ZeroMQ notifications to Ordhook to retrieve the inscriptions.

### Add `http-post` endpoints dynamically

To enable dynamically posting endpoints to the server, you can spin up the Redis server by enabling the following lines of code in the `Ordhook.toml` file:

```toml
[http_api]
http_port = 20456
database_uri = "redis://localhost:6379/"
```

## Run ordhook service

Based on the `Ordhook.toml` file configuration, the Ordhook service spins up an HTTP API to manage event destinations. Use the following command to start the Ordhook service:

`ordhook service start --config-path=./Ordhook.toml`

A comprehensive OpenAPI specification explaining how to interact with this HTTP REST API can be found [here](https://github.com/hirosystems/ordhook/blob/develop/docs/ordhook-openapi.json).
