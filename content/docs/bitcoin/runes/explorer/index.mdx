The Ordinals Explorer lets you explore and verify Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 token data. You can also use a variety of filters to discover inscriptions. We maintain and support the [Ordinals Explorer](https://ordinals.hiro.so) as a service for the community, but you can also run your own instance of the explorer if you so choose.
