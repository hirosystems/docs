description: The Rune API provides you with fast, reliable data for Bitcoin runes and BRC-20 tokens via an easy-to-use REST interface.
---

The Rune API is a service that helps you with the complete ingestion of Bitcoin rune data. Using our endpoints, you can retrieve metadata for a particular rune, trading activity, all runes held by a particular address, and more.

The Rune API uses REST endpoints and cached responses in order to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary requests. Start integrating Bitcoin runes into your app with one of the most reliable APIs on the market today.
