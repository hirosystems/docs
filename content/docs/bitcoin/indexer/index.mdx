The Bitcoin Indexer is a reorg-aware indexer that automatically handles chain forks, so you don't need to waste time or resources reindexing your database yourself.

You can customize what ordinals data you index in order to create lightweight databases for faster query responses and a better user experience.

## Installation

```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/hirosystems/bitcoin-indexer.git
$ cd bitcoin-indexer
$ cargo bitcoin-indexer-install
```

Alternatively, you can use Docker images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hirosystems/bitcoin-indexer).
