import { Mermaid } from '@/components/mdx/mermaid';

In this quickstart, you'll set up contract monitoring to track activity on a Stacks smart contract and receive real-time webhook notifications when specific events occur.

## Prerequisites

- A Hiro Platform account (free) - [Sign up here](https://platform.hiro.so)
- A webhook endpoint URL (HTTPS) - You can use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) for testing
- A Stacks contract address to monitor

## Getting started

Contract monitoring is available to all Hiro Platform users. To create your first monitor:

1. Sign in to the [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so)
2. Navigate to the Contract Monitoring section
3. Click "Create Monitor" and enter your contract address
4. Configure your webhook endpoint
5. Select the events you want to monitor

## How it works

Contract monitoring uses the Stacks Blockchain API to track on-chain events:

    C --> D{Filter Rules}

    D -->|No Match| F[Ignored]
    E --> G[Your Application]

    style D fill:#B3D9FF,stroke:#0d0c0c,stroke-width:2px,color:#0d0c0c"
/>

When transactions interact with your monitored contracts, the Platform evaluates them against your configured filters and sends matching events to your webhook endpoint in real-time.

## Verify it's working

To test your monitor, interact with the contract you're monitoring. For example, if monitoring a token contract, try transferring tokens:

```clarity
(contract-call? .monitored-token transfer u100 tx-sender 'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE)
```

You should receive a webhook payload within seconds:

```json
{
  "monitor_id": "mon_abc123def456",
  "contract_id": "SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR.arkadiko-dao",
  "event": {
    "type": "contract_call",
    "function": "transfer",
    "args": {
      "amount": "100",
      "sender": "SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR",
      "recipient": "SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE"
    }
  },
  "block_height": 98765,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45Z"
}
```
