## Monitors

A monitor is a configuration that watches a specific smart contract for activity. Each monitor consists of:

```json
{
  "contract_id": "SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR.arkadiko-dao",
  "webhook_url": "https://api.example.com/webhooks/stacks",
  "event_filters": ["contract-call", "stx-transfer"],
  "active": true
}
```

### Monitor lifecycle

Monitors operate in three states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `active` | Processing events and sending webhooks |
| `paused` | Temporarily stopped, retains configuration |
| `deleted` | Permanently removed, stops all notifications |

## Event types

Contract monitoring tracks different types of blockchain events:

### Contract calls

Function invocations on your smart contract:
- Public function calls
- Read-only function calls (off-chain)
- Internal contract calls

### Token events

STX and token movements involving your contract:
- STX transfers to/from contract
- Fungible token operations (SIP-010)
- Non-fungible token operations (SIP-009)

### Print events

Custom events emitted by your contract:
```clarity
(print { event: "loan-created", amount: u1000000 })
```

## Webhook delivery

Webhooks are HTTP POST requests sent to your configured endpoint when matching events occur.

### Webhook payload structure

```json
{
  "monitor_id": "mon_abc123",
  "contract_id": "SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR.arkadiko-dao",
  "transaction": {
    "tx_id": "0x123...",
    "block_height": 98765,
    "timestamp": 1704067200
  },
  "event": {
    "type": "contract_call",
    "function": "stake",
    "args": {
      "amount": "1000000"
    },
    "result": "(ok true)"
  }
}
```

## Event filtering

Filters let you receive only the events you care about, reducing noise and processing overhead.

### Filter types

**Function filters**
```json
{
  "type": "contract_call",
  "function_name": "transfer"
}
```

**Event type filters**
```json
{
  "type": "stx_transfer",
  "direction": "inbound"
}
```

**Amount filters**
```json
{
  "type": "stx_transfer",
  "min_amount": "1000000"
}
```
