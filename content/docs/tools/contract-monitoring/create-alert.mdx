## Set up contract monitoring

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Navigate to monitoring
    
    Log into the [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so) and toggle to the **Monitor** tab.
    
    You can set up alert monitoring for any contracts on mainnet.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add contract for monitoring
    
    Click **Add contract** to open the contract lookup modal.
    
    You have two options:
    - **Manual entry**: Enter the contract principal and contract name
    - **Wallet connection**: Connect your wallet to see your deployment history
    
    All contracts deployed to mainnet are public, so you can monitor any of them regardless of who deployed them.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### View contract activity
    
    Once added, your contract appears under Contract Monitoring where you can:
    - View transaction history
    - See pending transactions in the mempool
    - Click **Create an alert** to set up specific monitoring
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure custom alerts
    
    Set up alerts for any contract function calls with specific conditions:
    
    - **Function called**: Alert when a particular function is called
    - **With arguments**: Alert only when called with specified argument values
    - **By address**: Alert only when called by a specific wallet address
    
    For example, monitor `set-contract-owner`, transfer/mint/burn functions, or any custom functions you've implemented.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Choose notification method
    
    Select how you want to receive alerts:
    
    - **Email notifications**: Receive alerts at your email address
    - **Webhook calls**: Send to your API endpoint for custom workflows
    
    You can enable multiple notification methods for the same alert.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alert payload format

Email notifications come from Hiro Platform `<platform@hiro.so>`.

Webhook payloads follow this structure:

:::callout
The `tx_status` will always return "pending" for monitor alerts. Notifications are sent when transactions hit the mempool, not when they're confirmed on the blockchain.
