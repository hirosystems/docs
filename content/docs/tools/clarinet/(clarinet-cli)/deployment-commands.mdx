description: Deploy your contracts to different networks using Clarinet
---

## Overview

Clarinet provides powerful deployment commands to help you deploy your smart contracts to various networks including devnet, testnet, and mainnet. This guide covers the key deployment commands and their usage.

## Deploy Command

The `clarinet deploy` command deploys your contracts according to your deployment plan.

### Basic Usage

```bash
clarinet deploy [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `--network` - Target network (devnet, testnet, mainnet)
- `--deployment-plan-path` - Path to custom deployment plan
- `--no-dashboard` - Disable the deployment dashboard
- `--use-on-chain-deployment-plan` - Use deployment plan from chain

### Examples

#### Deploy to Testnet
```bash
clarinet deploy --network testnet
```

#### Deploy to Mainnet
```bash
clarinet deploy --network mainnet
```

#### Deploy with Custom Plan
```bash
clarinet deploy --deployment-plan-path ./deployments/custom-plan.yaml
```

## Run Command

The `clarinet run` command executes deployment plans or scripts.

### Basic Usage

```bash
clarinet run [SCRIPT] [OPTIONS]
```

### Examples

#### Run a Deployment Script
```bash
clarinet run scripts/deploy-all.ts
```

#### Run with Arguments
```bash
clarinet run scripts/setup.ts --arg1 value1 --arg2 value2
```

## Deployment Plans

Deployment plans define how your contracts should be deployed.

### Default Plan Structure

```yaml
---
id: 0
name: Devnet deployment
network: devnet
stacks-node: "http://localhost:20443"
bitcoin-node: "http://localhost:18443"
plan:
  batches:
    - id: 0
      transactions:
        - contract-publish:
            contract-name: my-contract
            expected-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
            cost: 5960
            path: contracts/my-contract.clar
            clarity-version: 2
```

### Creating Custom Plans

1. Generate a base plan:
```bash
clarinet deployment generate --network testnet
```

2. Modify the generated plan
3. Deploy using the custom plan

## Checking Deployment Status

### View Contract Status
```bash
clarinet check --network testnet
```

### Transaction Monitoring
Monitor your deployment transactions:

```bash
# Watch deployment progress
clarinet deploy --network testnet --no-dashboard
```

## Multi-Contract Deployments

Deploy multiple contracts in order:

```yaml
plan:
  batches:
    - id: 0
      transactions:
        - contract-publish:
            contract-name: trait-contract
            path: contracts/traits.clar
    - id: 1
      transactions:
        - contract-publish:
            contract-name: implementation
            path: contracts/impl.clar
            depends-on:
              - trait-contract
```

## Environment-Specific Deployments

### Development
```bash
# Local devnet (default)
clarinet deploy
```

### Staging/Testnet
```bash
# Deploy to testnet with specific account
clarinet deploy --network testnet --deployment-plan-path ./deployments/testnet.yaml
```

### Production/Mainnet
```bash
# Deploy to mainnet with confirmation
clarinet deploy --network mainnet --deployment-plan-path ./deployments/mainnet.yaml
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment:

1. **Verify Contract Code**
```bash
# Check deployed contract
clarinet check --network mainnet
```

2. **Test Contract Functions**
```bash
# Use console to interact
clarinet console --network mainnet
```

3. **Monitor Events**
Use Chainhook or the explorer to monitor contract events.

## Best Practices

1. **Test on Devnet First**
   - Always test deployments locally
   - Verify all functions work as expected

2. **Use Testnet Before Mainnet**
   - Deploy to testnet first
   - Run integration tests
   - Monitor for issues

3. **Version Your Deployment Plans**
   - Keep deployment plans in version control
   - Document changes
   - Tag releases

4. **Estimate Costs**
   ```bash
   clarinet cost --network mainnet
   ```

5. **Backup Keys**
   - Secure deployment keys
   - Use hardware wallets for mainnet
   - Never commit keys to repositories

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Insufficient Balance
```
Error: Insufficient STX balance for deployment
```
**Solution**: Ensure your account has enough STX for deployment costs.

#### Contract Already Deployed
```
Error: Contract with same name already exists
```
**Solution**: Use a different contract name or deploy to a different address.

#### Network Connection
```
Error: Failed to connect to node
```
**Solution**: Check network settings and node availability.

### Debug Mode
Run deployment with verbose output:
```bash
clarinet deploy --network testnet -v
```
