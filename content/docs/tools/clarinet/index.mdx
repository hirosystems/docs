Using a simple command line interface, Clarinet enables you to build and iterate on your contracts locally before moving into production on the `mainnet` network.

You can code with <TooltipProvider inline><Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className='cursor-default border-b border-dotted border-primary'>Clarity syntax support</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>Using the [Clarity VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HiroSystems.clarity-lsp#:~:text=This%20VS%20Code%20extension%20brings,safety%20checks%2C%20debugger%20and%20more)</TooltipContent></Tooltip></TooltipProvider>, run tests, debug your code line by line, and deploy your contracts to a local Stacks blockchain environment to rapidly iterate on your code.

## Set up shell completions

Clarinet already has many different commands built in. Therefore, enabling tab completion in your shell may be useful. Using the command below, you can use `clarinet` to generate the shell completion scripts for many common shells.

```terminal
$ clarinet completions (bash|elvish|fish|powershell|zsh)
```

After generating the file, you can refer to the documentation for your shell to determine where this file should be moved to and what other steps may be necessary to enable tab completion for `clarinet`.
