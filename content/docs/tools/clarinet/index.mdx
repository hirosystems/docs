## Overview

Clarinet is the fastest way to build, test, and deploy smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. It gives you a local devnet, REPL, testing framework, and debugging tools to ship high-quality Clarity code with confidence.

- ✓ [**Write unit tests with the SDK**](/tools/clarinet/sdk-introduction) - Use the Clarinet SDK to write unit tests in a familiar JS environment and validate contract behavior.

- ✓ [**Run a private blockchain environment**](/tools/clarinet/local-blockchain-development) - Spin up a local devnet with nodes, miners, and APIs so you can test and integrate your code.

- ✓ [**VSCode extension**](/tools/clarinet/vscode-extension) - Linter, step by step debugger, helps writing smart contracts (autocompletion, documentation etc).
