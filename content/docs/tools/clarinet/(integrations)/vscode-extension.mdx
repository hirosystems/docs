description: The Clarity VS Code extension transforms your editor into a powerful smart contract development environment. You get syntax highlighting, auto-completion, debugging, and real-time error checking.
---

## Features

### Smart auto-completion

The extension provides intelligent code completion that understands Clarity's context. When you start typing any Clarity function, you get instant suggestions with documentation:

```clarity
;; Type "stx-tr" and get:
(stx-transfer? amount sender recipient)
;;             ^      ^      ^
;;             Placeholders for easy navigation
```

Use `Tab` to jump between placeholders and `Escape` to exit placeholder mode.

### Documentation on hover

Access comprehensive documentation without leaving your editor. Hover over any Clarity function or keyword to see:

```clarity
;; Hover over 'map-set' to see:
;; - Function signature
;; - Parameter descriptions  
;; - Return type
;; - Usage examples
(map-set my-map {key: "value"} "data")
```

### Go-to definition

Navigate your codebase efficiently with jump-to-definition features:

- `F12` or `Ctrl+Click` - Go to definition
- `Alt+F12` - Peek definition without leaving current file
- Works across contract files and contract calls

### Real-time error checking

The extension validates your code continuously, providing immediate feedback:

- **Red squiggles** - Syntax errors, unknown keywords
- **Yellow squiggles** - Warnings for potentially unsafe code
- **Error list** - All issues in the Problems panel (`Ctrl+Shift+M`)

Common errors caught include undefined variables, type mismatches, missing trait implementations, and invalid function signatures.

### Local contract resolution

Auto-completion works across your entire project. Reference functions from other contracts in your workspace:

```clarity
;; Auto-complete local contract calls
(contract-call? .my-token transfer amount sender recipient)
;;               ^
;;               Suggests contracts in your project
```

### Trait support

When implementing traits (like SIP-009 NFTs or SIP-010 tokens), the extension verifies:

- All required functions are implemented
- Function signatures match trait definitions  
- Return types are correct

```clarity
;; Extension warns if missing required trait functions
(impl-trait .sip-010-trait.sip-010-trait)

;; ⚠️ Warning: Missing required function 'get-balance'
```

### Visual debugging

The extension includes a visual debugger for step-by-step code execution:

1. Set breakpoints by clicking line numbers
2. Press `F5` or use Run → Start Debugging
3. Step through code line-by-line
4. Inspect variables and stack state

<Callout type="info" title="Requirements">
Visual debugging requires VS Code Desktop and Clarinet installed locally.

## Comparison table

| Feature | Basic Editor | VS Code Extension |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Syntax highlighting | Limited | Full Clarity support |
| Auto-completion | None | Context-aware with docs |
| Error checking | On deploy only | Real-time validation |
| Documentation | External lookup | Inline hover docs |
| Debugging | Console only | Visual debugger |
| Cross-file navigation | Manual | Jump to definition |

## Best practices

- **Hover before assuming** - Check function documentation inline
- **Let auto-completion guide you** - Use suggestions to avoid typos
- **Pay attention to squiggles** - They catch real issues early
- **Use the debugger** - Step through complex logic visually

## Common misconceptions

<Callout type="warn" title="Common misconception">
The extension only provides syntax highlighting.

**Reality**: It offers a complete development environment with debugging, error checking, intelligent code completion, and project-wide navigation.
