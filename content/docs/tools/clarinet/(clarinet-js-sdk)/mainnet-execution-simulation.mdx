description: Mainnet Execution Simulation (MXS) allows you to test your Clarity smart contracts using actual data and state from the Stacks mainnet. This powerful feature helps ensure your contracts behave as expected in a live environment.

## What is Mainnet execution simulation?

Testing smart contracts in realistic conditions is essential. Simnet offers an isolated environment but lacks the live Stacks mainnet's complexity and history.

MXS fills this gap by enabling unit tests with the Clarinet JS SDK and Vitest to simulate the Stacks mainnet state at a specific block height. This allows you to:

- **Validate contract logic with real data:** Directly test mainnet contracts or data within your tests.
- **(Re)simulate transactions:** Analyze mainnet transactions' results, execution, or costs without deploying or using actual STX.

## Enable MXS in your project

Add the following configuration to your `Clarinet.toml` file:

```toml Clarinet.toml
[repl.remote_data]
# Enable mainnet execution simulation
enabled = true
# Specify the Stacks block height to fork from
initial_height = 522000
# API URL (optional, defaults to https://api.hiro.so)
api_url = 'https://api.hiro.so'
```

### Pro tip
Setting a specific `initial_height` ensures consistent and reproducible test results.

## Configure API access

While MXS works without an API key, you may encounter rate limits. Set up an API key for reliable access:

```terminal
$ export HIRO_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

## Write tests with mainnet data

Once MXS is enabled, your tests automatically operate against the mainnet state snapshot. Here's an example testing against the mainnet `pox-4` contract:

```ts tests/pox-4.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { Cl } from "@stacks/transactions";

const accounts = simnet.getAccounts();
const deployer = accounts.get("deployer")!;

describe("pox-4 mainnet interaction", () => {
  it("reads current reward cycle from mainnet", () => {
    // Call the mainnet pox-4 contract
    const call = simnet.callReadOnlyFn(
      "SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78.pox-4", // Mainnet contract
      "current-pox-reward-cycle",
      [],
      deployer
    );
    
    // Assert the result (adjust based on your initial_height)
    expect(call.result).toBeUint(109);
    
    console.log("Current POX reward cycle:", Cl.prettyPrint(call.result));
  });
});
```

The test uses `simnet.callReadOnlyFn` just like in standard unit tests, but because MXS is enabled, it targets the actual `pox-4` contract state at the specified block height.

## Try it out

Run your test to see MXS in action:

```terminal
$ npm run test
```

## Common issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Rate limit errors | Set up `HIRO_API_KEY` environment variable |
| Inconsistent results | Fix `initial_height` in configuration |
| Function not found | Check the contract exists at your block height |

## Testing in the playground

Quickly experiment with MXS without setting up a project:

1. Visit [https://play.hiro.so/?remote_data=true](https://play.hiro.so/?remote_data=true)
2. Run mainnet contract calls:

```terminal
$ contract-call? 'SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78.pox-4 current-pox-reward-cycle
```
