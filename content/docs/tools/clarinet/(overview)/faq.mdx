This page addresses common questions and issues encountered when developing with Clarinet, based on community feedback and support interactions.

## Testing and development

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="sbtc-testing">
    <AccordionTrigger>How do I test with sBTC tokens in my development environment?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <div className="pb-4 pt-2">
        To test with sBTC tokens, add the mainnet sBTC contract as a requirement and mint tokens using the deployer address:

        **Step 1: Add sBTC as a requirement**
        ```terminal
        $ clarinet requirements add SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token
        ```

        **Step 2: Mint sBTC in your tests**
        ```typescript
        // The sBTC multisig address that can mint
        const sbtcDeployer = "SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4";

        // Mint sBTC to your test wallet
        const mintTx = simnet.callPublicFn(
          "SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token",
          "mint",
          [Cl.uint(1000000), Cl.principal(wallet1)],
          sbtcDeployer
        );
        ```

        This approach allows you to work with sBTC in unit tests without complex Bitcoin transaction simulation.

  <AccordionItem value="mainnet-simulation-addresses">
    <AccordionTrigger>Why am I getting an error when using mainnet addresses during mainnet simulation?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <div className="pb-4 pt-2">
        When using mainnet execution simulation, it's possible that the mainnet contract is checking for mainnet address contract calls, not testnet addresses.

        **As of Clarinet v3.4.0**, you can enable mainnet addresses in simnet by adding `use_mainnet_wallets = true` to your configuration:

        ```toml Clarinet.toml
        [repl.remote_data]
        enabled = true
        initial_height = 522000
        use_mainnet_wallets = true  # Enable mainnet addresses
        ```

        **Alternative: Manually use mainnet addresses:**
        ```typescript
        // Instead of using simnet.getAccounts()
        const mainnetAddress = "SP3R4F6C1J3JQWWCVZ3S7FRRYPMYG6ZW6RZK31FXY";

        // Mint STX to any mainnet address
        simnet.mintSTX(mainnetAddress, 1000000n);

        // Call functions with mainnet address
        const result = simnet.callReadOnlyFn(
          "SP3R4F6C1J3JQWWCVZ3S7FRRYPMYG6ZW6RZK31FXY.pyth-storage-v3",
          "get-price",
          [priceFeed],
          mainnetAddress
        );
        ```

        The simnet is permissive and accepts any valid Stacks address when mainnet simulation is enabled.

  <AccordionItem value="testing-helpers-migration">
    <AccordionTrigger>How do I migrate from expectSTXTransferEvent to the new SDK?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <div className="pb-4 pt-2">
        The Clarinet v2 SDK uses standard Vitest matchers instead of custom event helpers. Here's how to migrate:

        **Old approach (Clarinet v1):**
        ```typescript
        block.receipts[0].events.expectSTXTransferEvent(
          amount,
          sender,
          recipient
        );
        ```

        **New approach (Clarinet v2):**
        ```typescript
        // Check for exact event match
        expect(events).toContainEqual({
          event: "stx_transfer_event",
          data: {
            amount: "1000000",
            memo: "",
            recipient: "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM",
            sender: "ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5",
          },
        });

        // Or check only specific properties
        expect(events).toContainEqual({
          event: "stx_transfer_event",
          data: expect.objectContaining({
            sender: address1,
            recipient: contractAddress,
          }),
        });
        ```

        For Clarity value assertions, use the built-in matchers:
        ```typescript
        expect(result).toBeOk(Cl.bool(true));
        expect(result).toBeErr(Cl.uint(500));
        ```

## Configuration and setup

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="mnemonic-24-words">
    <AccordionTrigger>Why am I getting "bip39 error" when generating deployment plans?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <div className="pb-4 pt-2">
        Starting with Clarinet 2.15.0, deployment configurations require 24-word mnemonics. 12-word mnemonics are no longer supported.

        **Update your configuration:**
        ```toml settings/Mainnet.toml
        [accounts.deployer]
        # Use a 24-word mnemonic
        mnemonic = "twice kind fence tip hidden tilt action fragile skin nothing glory cousin green tomorrow spring wrist shed math olympic multiply hip blue scout claw"
        ```

        Generate a new 24-word mnemonic using a BIP39 generator if needed. This change improves security for production deployments.

## Known limitations

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="bitcoin-testing-limitations">
    <AccordionTrigger>Can I test Bitcoin transaction verification in Clarinet?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <div className="pb-4 pt-2">
        Testing contracts that use clarity-bitcoin-lib for Bitcoin transaction verification has limitations in simnet and devnet:

        **Current limitations:**
        - No real Bitcoin blocks or transactions in simnet
        - Mock blocks don't contain verifiable Bitcoin transactions
        - `get-burn-block-info?` returns mock data unsuitable for verification

        **Workarounds:**
        - Test Bitcoin verification logic on mainnet or with mainnet execution simulation
        - Create unit tests that mock expected behavior without actual verification
        - Consider separating Bitcoin verification logic for easier testing

        The Clarinet team is exploring solutions for better Bitcoin testing support.

  <AccordionItem value="epoch-transition">
    <AccordionTrigger>Why does my devnet freeze at epoch 3.0 transition?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <div className="pb-4 pt-2">
        The epoch 3.0 transition in devnet can be unstable, with success rates varying between 50-80% depending on your setup.

        **Current workarounds:**
        - Restart devnet if it freezes around blocks 139-140
        - Try Clarinet 2.14.0 which some users report as more stable
        - Wait for the upcoming feature to start devnet directly in epoch 3.0

        **Monitoring the transition:**
        ```console
        # Watch for the transition around these blocks
        Block 139: Epoch 2.5
        Block 140: Should transition to 3.0
        ```

        The Clarinet team is working on improving epoch transition stability and plans to allow starting devnet directly in epoch 3.0.
