---

This guide shows you how to run Chainhook as a service for continuous monitoring of blockchain events. You'll learn how to configure Chainhook with both Bitcoin and Stacks nodes, manage predicates dynamically, and optimize for production deployments.

## Basic service setup

Start Chainhook as a service using a configuration file:

```terminal
$ chainhook service start --config-path=./Chainhook.toml
```

The service connects to your blockchain nodes and begins monitoring for events that match your registered predicates.

### Minimal configuration

```toml Chainhook.toml
[storage]
working_dir = "/var/chainhook"

[network]
mode = "mainnet"

[limits]
max_number_of_bitcoin_predicates = 100
max_number_of_stacks_predicates = 10
```

## Bitcoin node configuration

Configure Chainhook to work with a Bitcoin node for monitoring Bitcoin events:

```toml Chainhook.toml
[network]
mode = "mainnet"
bitcoind_rpc_url = "http://localhost:8332"
bitcoind_rpc_username = "devnet"
bitcoind_rpc_password = "devnet"

# Option 1: Receive events via ZeroMQ (recommended for Bitcoin-only)
bitcoind_zmq_url = "tcp://0.0.0.0:18543"

# Option 2: Receive events via Stacks node (if running both chains)
# stacks_node_rpc_url = "http://localhost:20443"
```

### Bitcoin configuration mapping

| bitcoin.conf | Chainhook.toml |
|--------------|----------------|
| rpcuser | bitcoind_rpc_username |
| rpcpassword | bitcoind_rpc_password |
| rpcport | bitcoind_rpc_url |
| zmqpubhashblock | bitcoind_zmq_url |

## Stacks node configuration

For monitoring Stacks events, configure both the Stacks node and Chainhook:

### Stacks node setup

```toml Stacks.toml
[node]
working_dir = "/stacks-blockchain"
rpc_bind = "0.0.0.0:20443"
p2p_bind = "0.0.0.0:20444"

[burnchain]
chain = "bitcoin"
mode = "mainnet"
peer_host = "localhost"
username = "devnet"      # Must match bitcoin.conf rpcuser
password = "devnet"      # Must match bitcoin.conf rpcpassword
rpc_port = 8332          # Must match bitcoin.conf rpcport

[[events_observer]]
endpoint = "localhost:20455"
retry_count = 255
events_keys = ["*"]
```

### Chainhook configuration for Stacks

```toml Chainhook.toml
[network]
mode = "mainnet"
bitcoind_rpc_url = "http://localhost:8332"
bitcoind_rpc_username = "devnet"
bitcoind_rpc_password = "devnet"
stacks_node_rpc_url = "http://localhost:20443"
stacks_events_ingestion_port = 20455
```

## Predicate management

Register predicates with the service to start monitoring for specific events.

### Start with predicates

```terminal
$ chainhook service start --predicate-path=my-predicate.json --config-path=Chainhook.toml
```

### Dynamic registration

Enable the HTTP API to register predicates while the service is running:

```toml Chainhook.toml
[http_api]
http_port = 20456
database_uri = "redis://localhost:6379/"
```

Register a new predicate via API:

```terminal
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:20456/v1/chainhooks \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d @predicate.json

{"result":"f8d43129-dba1-4a6c-b368-21426de0f3cd","status":200}
```

## Service monitoring

Monitor the health and status of your Chainhook service.

### Health check

```terminal
$ curl http://localhost:20456/health
```

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "stacks_node": "connected",
  "bitcoin_node": "connected",
  "database": "connected",
  "predicates_active": 3
}
```
