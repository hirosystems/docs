## Register Chainhooks on devnet

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Create predicate files
    
    Create your Chainhook predicate files in your Clarinet project directory. You can place them in the project root or organize them in a dedicated folder.

    ```json chainhooks/increment.json
    {
      "chain": "stacks",
      "uuid": "1",
      "name": "Increment Counter",
      "version": 1,
      "networks": {
        "devnet": {
          "if_this": {
            "scope": "contract_call",
            "contract_identifier": "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.counter",
            "method": "increment"
          },
          "then_that": {
            "http_post": {
              "url": "http://localhost:3000/api/increment",
              "authorization_header": "Bearer devnet-token"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The predicate will trigger whenever the `increment` method is called on your counter contract.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Organize project structure
    
    Structure your project with Chainhook files in a logical location. Here's a recommended project layout:

    ```
    my-project/
    ├── contracts/
    │   └── counter.clar
    ├── chainhooks/
    │   ├── increment.json
    │   └── decrement.json
    ├── tests/
    │   └── counter.test.ts
    └── Clarinet.toml
    ```

    Clarinet will automatically discover predicate files in your project directory when starting devnet.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Start devnet with Chainhook registration
    
    Launch devnet from your project root. Clarinet automatically starts a Chainhook service and registers all predicate files it finds.

    ```terminal
    $ clarinet devnet start
    ```

    Look for the registration confirmation in your terminal output:

    ```console
    Computing deployment plan
    ✔ Deployment plan completed
    
    INFO Feb  5 15:20:07.233382 2 chainhooks registered
    ```

    This message confirms your predicates are active and monitoring the local blockchain.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Verify Chainhook execution
    
    Interact with your contracts to trigger the registered Chainhooks. Monitor the devnet terminal for execution confirmations.

    ```terminal
    $ clarinet console
    >> (contract-call? .counter increment)
    ```

    Watch the devnet terminal for triggered hooks:

    ```console
    INFO Feb  5 15:21:07.233382 1 hooks triggered
    ```

    Your webhook endpoint or file output will receive the event payload based on your `then_that` configuration.
