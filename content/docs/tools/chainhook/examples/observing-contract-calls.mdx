The _json`contract_call`_ predicate scope is designed to target direct function calls within a smart contract. When triggered, Chainhook will return a payload with transaction data detailing the on-chain events contained in these functions.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. [Build a predicate to target the `cast-vote` function](#creating-the-predicate).
2. [Scan the Stacks blockchain using your predicate](#running-the-predicate).
3. [Use a Clarity function to return specific contract data](#return-contract-data-with-the-clarity-function).
4. [Find data related to the contract call within the Chainhook payload](#chainhook-payload).

<Callout type="warn" title="Requirements">
  To follow this guide, make sure you have installed Chainhook [directly](/stacks/chainhook/installation).
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>

## Create the predicate

The `predicate` is your main interface for querying the Chainhook data indexer. Chainhook uses this predicate to select the appropriate blockchain, network, and scope for monitoring transactions.

For the Stacks blockchain, run the following command to generate a `predicate` template:

```terminal
$ chainhook predicates new contract-call-chainhook.json --stacks
```

<Callout title="Note">
  Alternatively, [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/) has an excellent UI to help you to create a `predicate` using a form builder or upload a json file containing your `predicate`.
</Callout>

There are 3 main components to your `predicate` that you need to address:

1. Targeting the appropriate blockchain and network
2. Defining the scope and targeting the function you want to observe
3. Defining the payload destination

To begin, you need to configure the `predicate` to target the voting contract:

- Specify `testnet` in the network object.
- Set the `start_block` property to <TooltipProvider inline><Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className='cursor-default border-dotted border-b border-primary'>21443</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>This value represents the block height that our voting contract was deployed at.</TooltipContent></Tooltip></TooltipProvider>.

```json contract-call-chainhook.json
{
  "chain": "stacks",
  "uuid": "1",
  "name": "Contract-Call-Chainhook",
  "version": 1,
  "networks": {
    "testnet": {
      "start_block": 21443,
      "decode_clarity_values": true,
      "expire_after_occurrence": 1,
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

Next, define the scope of the `predicate` within the `if_this` specification.

The `contract_call` scope allows Chainhook to observe blockchain data when the specified function is directly called from its contract.

```json contract-call-chainhook.json
{
  "if_this": {
    "scope": "contract_call",
    "contract_identifier": "STJ81C2WPQHFB6XTG518JKPABWM639R2X37VFKJV.simple-vote-v0",
    "method": "cast-vote"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  The function defined in the `method` property of your `predicate` must be directly called in order for Chainhook to observe events. Calling the function from another contract or from within a different function on the same contract will not generate a `payload`. Below is an example of a `cast-vote` function that would not trigger an event.
  ```clarity
  (define-public (call-cast-vote)
    (cast-vote)
  )
  ```
</Callout>

Finally, define how Chainhook delivers the payload when it is triggered by your `predicate` using the `then_that` specification. 

Using `file_append`, specify the path where Chainhook will post the payload data.

```json contract-call-chainhook.json
{
  "then_that": {
    "file_append": {
      "path": "/tmp/events.json"
    }
  }
}
```

            },

              "file_append": {
                "path": "/tmp/events.json"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

## Scan the predicate

With your `predicate` set up, you can now scan for blocks that match the `contract_call` scope and analyze the returned payload.

Chainhook will track events where this function is directly invoked and deliver detailed transaction data at the block level, based on your configuration.

To scan the Stacks blockchain using your predicate, run the following command, replacing `/path/to/contract-call-chainhook.json` with the actual path to your `contract-call-chainhook.json` file:

```terminal
$ chainhook predicates scan /path/to/contract-call-chainhook.json --testnet
```

<Callout title="Note">
  If you are using Platform, creating your Chainhook will automatically begin the scan for you.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

## Return contract data with the Clarity function

The _clarity`cast-vote`_ function records a vote by storing the address that calls it. It also logs relevant data using the _clarity`print`_ function, which can be useful for when you want to track additional on-chain events that are not part of the built-in Clarity functions.

When you examine the `payload`, this is the data you will look for.

```clarity simple-vote-v0.clar
(define-public (cast-vote)
  (begin
    ;; Check if the voter has already voted.
    (asserts! (is-none (map-get? UserVotes tx-sender)) (err ERR_ALREADY_VOTED))

    ;; Update the map that the vote has been cast.  Print vote related data.
    (map-set UserVotes tx-sender { hasVoted: true })
    (var-set VoteCount (+ (var-get VoteCount) u1))
    (print
      {
        notification: "cast-vote",
        payload: {
          status: "Has voted set to true",
          voter: tx-sender,
          totalVotes: (get-total-votes)
        }
      }
    )
    (ok "Vote cast successfully")
  )
)
```

<Callout title="Note">
  This contract has been deployed to the Stacks [testnet network](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/0x312a3c559af0f75381a9eb4540912c310d74682ed3036207ec890ad8cd1aebe6?chain=testnet) under the name `STJ81C2WPQHFB6XTG518JKPABWM639R2X37VFKJV.simple-vote-v0`.

## Dive deeper into the Chainhook payload

When triggered by your predicate, the `payload` returned by Chainhook is a standarized, block level observation in json format.

Within the `apply` arrays element, the `block_identifer` object gives us the `index` for the observed block height.

```json contract-call-payload.json
"block_identifier": {
  "hash": "0x4d88015a6df9ec4f6df875941d87337ce64f8d51608563f80b6e27adeb327e4d",
  "index": 21544
}
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  The hash returned in the `block_identifer` object is not that block hash you
  would see in [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet), but
  `index_block_hash` returned from the Stacks API's [get
  block](/stacks/api/blocks/get-block) endpoint. You can use the `apply` array's
  metadata object to get the `stacks_block_hash`.
</Callout>

We can retrieve the `stacks_block_hash` by navigating to the `apply` arrays object `metadata` element. This hash will match the block hash display in the Stacks Explorer.

```json contract-call-payload.json
"apply": [
  {
    "metadata": {
      "stacks_block_hash": "0x4ad36f77ff76042f3b7355006556375970b0f99d1232b14a3b4a2eadda4a806a"
    }
  }
]
```

There is also a `timestamp` value returned in the `apply` array. This UNIX time stamp represents the initiation of the Stacks block.

```json contract-call-payload.json
"timestamp": 1722208524
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  The timestamp returned in this object is not the finalized block time you
  would see in the [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet), but
  `block_time` returned from the Stacks API's [get
  block](/stacks/api/blocks/get-block) endpoint.
</Callout>

### Transaction object

Because Chainhook is triggered on the block level, we will receive a single response that contains data specific to each `transaction` that matches your predicate's `contract_call` scope.

To find this data, we start with the `apply` array element of the `payload` object. The single object that makes up the `apply` array contains a child element, the `transactions` array. Every `transaction` will be represents by a single object within this array. This `transaction` object contains its own children elements which can be seen in the example below.

```json
{
  "apply": [
    {
      "transactions": [
        {
          "transaction_identifier": { ... },
          "metdata": { ... },
          "operations": [],
        }
      ],
    }
  ],
  "rollback": [ ... ],
  "chainhook": { ... }
}
```

Once the `transaction` object is returned, we can begin examining the important data elements this object contains. The first element, `transaction_identifier`, includes a hash value that uniquely identifies your transaction.

```json contract-call-payload.json
"transaction_identifier": {
  "hash": "0x98195af8f888d2f9ca3462c41c1691e7798ea6d9e5e3afe42955c0921f981f2c"
}
```

Next, focus on the `metadata` object within your `contract_call` data. It's crucial to determine the success state of your transaction. Chainhook captures and reports on transactions regardless of their outcome.

Utilize the `success` object to assess transaction success and extract the `sender` of the transaction and the `result` returned by the contract.

```json contract-call-payload.json
"metadata": {
  "success": true,
  "sender": "STJ81C2WPQHFB6XTG518JKPABWM639R2X37VFKJV",
  "result": "(ok \"Vote cast successfully\")"
}
```

Moving forward, examine the `kind` object and its components within your `contract_call`. The data object contains crucial information:

- `contract_identifier` specifies the contract your function resides in
- `method` identifies the function called
- `args` lists the arguments passed when invoking this function

In this case, the `cast-vote` function accepts no arguments, resulting in an empty `args` array.

```json contract-call-payload.json
{
  "metadata":
  "kind": {
    "data": {
      "args": [],
      "contract_identifier": "STJ81C2WPQHFB6XTG518JKPABWM639R2X37VFKJV.simple-vote-v0",
      "method": "cast-vote"
    }
  }
}
```

In the `metadata` object's `receipt`, the `events` array holds the key data for your `contract_call`.

Since the `cast-vote` function uses a `print` statement, the events array will contain `topic` and `value` keys representing the data output.

```json contract-call-payload.json
{
  "metadata":
  "receipt": {
    "contract_calls_stack": [],
    "events": [
      {
        "data": {
          "contract_identifier": "STJ81C2WPQHFB6XTG518JKPABWM639R2X37VFKJV.simple-vote-v0",
          "topic": "print",
          "value": {
            "notification": "cast-vote",
            "payload": {
              "status": "Has voted set to true",
              "totalVotes": 1,
              "voter": "STJ81C2WPQHFB6XTG518JKPABWM639R2X37VFKJV"
            }
          }
        },
        "position": {
          "index": 0
        },
        "type": "SmartContractEvent"
      }
    ],
    "mutated_assets_radius": [],
    "mutated_contracts_radius": [
      "STJ81C2WPQHFB6XTG518JKPABWM639R2X37VFKJV.simple-vote-v0"
    ]
  }
}
```

Now that you've located the relevant data in the payload, you can start to extract the relevant information into your API.

The following is an example of how you might store your information in a database table:

| Block Height | Timestamp  | Transaction Identifier                                             | Success | Sender                                   | Result                        | Args | Contract Identifier                                     | Function  | Value                                                                                                                                                   |
