description: Create a Chainhook predicate to track STX transfers on the Stacks blockchain and scan historical data to see it in action.
---

In this quickstart, you'll create your first Chainhook predicate to monitor STX transfers on the Stacks blockchain. You'll learn how to define event tracking rules and scan historical blockchain data to find matching transactions.

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Generate a predicate file
    
    Chainhook uses predicates to define what blockchain events to track. Generate a template predicate file:

    ```terminal
    $ chainhook predicates new stx-transfer.json --stacks
    ```

    This creates a boilerplate JSON file with the basic predicate structure. The `--stacks` flag specifies you're tracking Stacks events (use `--bitcoin` for Bitcoin).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure event tracking
    
    Open `stx-transfer.json` and update the `if_this` section to track STX transfer events:

    ```json stx-transfer.json
    {
      "chain": "stacks",
      "uuid": "87ac9bff-1052-4d02-9c79-3768a6f08a09",
      "name": "STX Transfer",
      "version": 1,
      "networks": {
        "mainnet": {
          "start_block": 154670,
          "if_this": {
            "scope": "stx_event",
            "actions": ["transfer"]
          },
          "then_that": {
            "file_append": {
              "path": "stx-transfers.txt"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This predicate will:
    - Track all STX transfer events (`scope: "stx_event"`, `actions: ["transfer"]`)
    - Start scanning from block 154670
    - Append matching events to `stx-transfers.txt`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Scan for events
    
    Run the scan command to search historical blockchain data:

    ```terminal
    $ chainhook predicates scan stx-transfer.json --mainnet
    ```

    :::callout
    The first `scan` downloads a chainstate archive from Hiro Archive. Subsequent scans use the cached data for faster performance.
    :::
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### View results
    
    Check the output file to see the transfer events:

    ```terminal
    $ head -5 stx-transfers.txt
    ```

    Each line contains a JSON payload with transfer details including sender, recipient, amount, and block information.
  </Step>
