In this quickstart guide, you will set up `Chainhook` to generate and scan predicates on the Stacks blockchain. You will learn how to generate predicates and run basic commands using the CLI to scan and inspect blockchain events.

Check out the [run Chainhook as a service](/stacks/chainhook/guides/chainhook-as-a-service) for a more advanced use case.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Generate a predicate file
  
    To generate a predicate file, use the `predicates new` command. This command generates a template that you can use to help set up your own predicate.

    ```terminal
    $ chainhook predicates new stx-transfer.json --stacks 
    ```

    <Callout title="Note">
      The `--stacks` flag is required and allows you to specify the network to scan. Other options include `--bitcoin`.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Track the latest stx_event for a given address
  
    The generated file contains helpful boilerplate configuration, but you still need to make some edits to tell it to track specific Stacks-related transactions.

    To do this, update your `if_this` construct in your `stx-transfer.json` file.

    ```json title="stx-transfer.json"
    {
      "if_this": {
        "scope": "stx_event",
        "actions": ["transfer"]
      }
    }
    ```

    <Accordions>
      <Accordion title="Full code example">
        ```json
          {
            "chain": "stacks",
            "uuid": "87ac9bff-1052-4d02-9c79-3768a6f08a09",
            "name": "STX Transfer",

                "if_this": {
                  "scope": "stx_event",
                  "contract_identifier": "SPM113AY78VCMJJ0SDFJ4XJXFHHQ6R9KB3710X7D",
                  "actions": ["transfer"]
                },
                "then_that": {
                  "file_append": {
                    "path": "stx-transfers.txt"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
          ```
      </Accordion>
    </Accordions>
  
    <Callout title="Note">
      Other available `actions` include `mint`, `burn`, and `lock`. For more information on these actions, check out the [predicates](/stacks/chainhook/concepts/stacks-predicates) section.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Scanning for events
  
    With your updated predicate file, you can now use the `predicate scan` command to scan for `stx_event` transactions.

    ```terminal
    $ chainhook predicates scan /path/to/stx-transfer.json --mainnet
    ```

    <Callout title="Note">
      When running `scan` for the first time, a chainstate archive will be downloaded. The subsequent scans will use the cached chainstate if already present, speeding up iterations and the overall feedback loop. For more information on the Hiro Archive, click [here](/stacks/archive).

  </Step>
