## Overview

The Bitcoin Indexer is a high-performance, reorg-aware indexing engine that tracks Bitcoin metaprotocols and serves API endpoints for Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 tokens. Unlike basic indexers, it automatically handles blockchain reorganizations, ensuring your data stays accurate without manual intervention.

![Bitcoin Indexer overview](/images/tools/bitcoin-indexer/overview.svg)

The indexer connects to your Bitcoin node, processes blocks in real-time, stores metaprotocol data in PostgreSQL, and serves REST APIs for each protocol.

## Key features

- **Metaprotocol indexing** - Built-in support for Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 with extensible architecture
- **Reorg-aware processing** - Automatically handles chain forks and reorganizations
- **REST API endpoints** - Production-ready APIs for Ordinals and Runes
- **Archive bootstrapping** - Quick sync from Hiro archives instead of full indexing

## Installation

```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/hirosystems/bitcoin-indexer.git
$ cd bitcoin-indexer && cargo build --release
```

Docker images are also available:

```terminal
$ docker pull hirosystems/bitcoin-indexer:latest
```
