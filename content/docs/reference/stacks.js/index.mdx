## Overview

Stacks.js is a collection of JavaScript libraries that enable you to build web applications on the Stacks blockchain. From wallet authentication to smart contract interactions, Stacks.js provides the essential building blocks for creating decentralized applications. [View on llms.txt](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks.js/blob/main/llms.txt)

## Key features

- ✓ **Transaction construction** - Build and broadcast all transaction types with type-safe APIs
- ✓ **Smart contract interaction** - Deploy contracts and call functions with automatic encoding
