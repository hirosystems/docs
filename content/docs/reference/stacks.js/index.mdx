## Overview

Stacks.js is a collection of JavaScript libraries that enable you to build web applications on the Stacks blockchain. From wallet authentication to smart contract interactions.

To explore Stacks.js with AI, copy and paste [llms.txt](/reference/stacks.js/llms.txt) into your LLM of choice.

## Key features

- **Transaction construction** - Build and broadcast all transaction types with type-safe APIs
- **Smart contract interaction** - Deploy contracts and call functions with automatic encoding
- **Wallet integration** - Connect to Leather, Xverse, and other Stacks wallets seamlessly
- **Post-conditions** - Protect users with built-in asset transfer validations
