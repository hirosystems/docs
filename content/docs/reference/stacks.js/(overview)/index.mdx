## Overview

Stacks.js is a collection of JavaScript/TypeScript libraries that enable developers to build decentralized applications on the Stacks blockchain. Whether you're building a web app that connects to users' wallets or creating command-line tools for contract deployment, Stacks.js provides all the building blocks you need.

The ecosystem includes both the core stacks.js packages for transaction building and utilities, as well as @stacks/connect for seamless web wallet integrations.

## Key features

- ✓ **Web wallet integration** - Connect to Hiro Wallet, Xverse, and other wallets with a unified API
- ✓ **Transaction building** - Construct any type of Stacks transaction with type-safe builders
- ✓ **Smart contract calls** - Call read-only functions and execute contract methods
- ✓ **Post-conditions** - Implement security checks to ensure transactions behave as expected

## Installation

Install the packages you need for your use case:

    <TabsTrigger value="web">Web Apps</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="node">Node.js/CLI</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  
  <TabsContent value="web">
    For web applications with wallet connectivity:
    
    ```package-install
    @stacks/connect @stacks/transactions @stacks/network
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  
  <TabsContent value="node">
    For Node.js applications and CLI tools:
    
    ```package-install
    @stacks/transactions @stacks/network @stacks/encryption
    ```
  </TabsContent>

## Quick example

Here's a simple example of connecting a wallet and sending STX:

```typescript
import { showConnect } from '@stacks/connect';
import { StacksMainnet } from '@stacks/network';
import { AnchorMode, makeSTXTokenTransfer } from '@stacks/transactions';

// Connect wallet
showConnect({
  appDetails: {
    name: 'My App',
    icon: 'https://example.com/icon.png',
  },
  onFinish: () => {
    console.log('Wallet connected!');
  },
  userSession, // Your app's user session
});

// Send STX (user approves in wallet)
const tx = await makeSTXTokenTransfer({
  recipient: 'SP2J6Y09JMFWWZCT4VJX0BA5W7A9HZP5EX96Y6VZY',
  amount: 1000000, // 1 STX in microSTX
  anchorMode: AnchorMode.Any,
});

showConnect({
  transaction: tx,
  network: new StacksMainnet(),
  onFinish: (data) => {
    console.log('Transaction sent:', data.txId);
  },
});
```

## Core concepts

### Wallet-based vs local key management

Stacks.js supports two primary modes of operation:

**Wallet-based (Web Apps)**
- Users control their private keys through wallet software
- Transactions require user approval in their wallet
- Best for user-facing applications
- Use `@stacks/connect` for wallet interactions

**Local key management (Scripts/CLI)**
- Your application manages private keys directly
- Transactions are signed programmatically
- Best for backend services and development tools
- Use `@stacks/transactions` with private keys

### Understanding post-conditions

Post-conditions are a unique Stacks feature that add an extra layer of security to transactions. They ensure that a transaction will only succeed if certain conditions are met after execution.

```typescript
// Ensure exactly 1 STX is transferred
const postConditions = [
  makeStandardSTXPostCondition(
    senderAddress,
    FungibleConditionCode.Equal,
    1000000 // 1 STX
  ),
];
```
