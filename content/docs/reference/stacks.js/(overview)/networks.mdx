Typically, we speak of `mainnet` and `testnet` as the networks of Stacks.
Most wallets are configured to `mainnet` by default—this is the production environment, the actual blockchain that holds real STX tokens.

As the name suggests, `testnet` is a public network for testing.
It's a separate blockchain state that holds test tokens, which have no value.

For completeness we also mention `devnet`.
This isn't "one" network, but how developers refer to ephemeral local networks used for testing.
It is the same as `testnet`, but for local development.

## Setting the network

Most Stacks.js functions accept a `network` parameter or an optional last argument.

The `network` type is a string, and can be one of:
- `'mainnet'` (default)
- `'testnet'`
- `'devnet'`
- `'mocknet'` (alias of `devnet`)

### Examples

Network in transaction signing:
```ts
const tx = makeSTXTokenTransfer({
  // ...
  network: 'testnet',
});
```

Network in address derivation:
```ts
const address = privateKeyToAddress(privateKey, 'devnet');

### Advanced usage
For more advanced uses, you can pass an object of a network configuration. Read more about the network object in the [`@stacks/network`](/reference/stacks.js/packages/network) package.
