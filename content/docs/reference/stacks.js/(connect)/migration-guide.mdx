description: How to migrate from v7.x.x to v8.x.x of @stacks/connect

import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps'


For a while now, the Stacks community has been working on a new standard for wallet-to-dapp communication.
Stacks Connect and related projects now use standards like [WBIPs](https://wbips.netlify.app/) and [SIP-030](https://github.com/janniks/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-030/sip-030-wallet-interface.md) to allow wallets to communicate with dapps in a more simplified and flexible way.

### Migration Status
Please be patient during this latest migration.
There has been a long-running effort together with wallets to modernize and move forward the Stacks web ecosystem.
It is now culminating in [SIP-030](https://github.com/janniks/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-030/sip-030-wallet-interface.md) and the new `request` method in Stacks Connect `8.x.x`.
Bear with us during this migration.
Wallets are still working through some bugs, details, and improvements.

_Feel free to continue using Stacks Connect `7.x.x` while things stabilize._
The `7.x.x` version may still be more well supported by some wallets.

For the legacy version of `@stacks/connect` using JWT tokens, you can use:

```sh
npm install @stacks/connect@7.10.1
```
:::

## Deprecations

The following classes, methods, and types are deprecated in favor of the new `request` RPC methods:

- `show...` and `open...` methods
- `authenticate` method
- `UserSession` class and related functionality
- `AppConfig` class
- `SessionOptions` interface
- `SessionData` interface
- `UserData` interface
- `SessionDataStore` class
- `InstanceDataStore` class
- `LocalStorageStore` class

### Backwards Compatibility
To make migrating easier, the familiar `UserSession` & `AppConfig` class still exists and is semi-backwards compatible for the `8.x.x` release.
It will "cache" the user's address in local storage and allow access to it via the `loadUserData` method (as previously done).

## Migration Steps

To update from `<=7.x.x` to latest/`8.x.x`, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update your @stacks/connect version">
  ```sh
  npm install @stacks/connect@latest
  ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace Legacy Methods with request">
  Switch from `showXyz`, `openXyz`, `doXyz` methods to the `request` method:

  - `request` follows the pattern `request(method: string, params: object)`, see [Usage](#usage) for more details
  - `request` is an async function, so replace the `onFinish` and `onCancel` callbacks with `.then().catch()` or `try & await`

  Examples:
  - `showConnect()`, `authenticate()` → `connect()`
  - `useConnect().doContractCall({})` → `request("stx_callContract", {})`
  - `openContractDeploy()` → `request("stx_deployContract", {})`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Connect Instead of ShowConnect/Authenticate">
  Switch from `showConnect` or `authenticate` to `connect()` methods:

  - `connect()` is an alias for `request({forceWalletSelect: true}, 'getAddresses')`
  - `connect()` by default caches the user's address in local storage
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Authentication State Management">
  - Switch from `UserSession.isSignedIn()` to `isConnected()`
  - Switch from `UserSession.signUserOut()` to `disconnect()`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove Legacy Code">
  - Remove code referencing deprecated methods (`AppConfig`, `UserSession`, etc.)
  - Remove the `@stacks/connect-react` package
    - You may need to manually reload a component to see local storage updates
    - No custom hooks are needed to use Stacks Connect anymore
    - We are working on a new `@stacks/react` package that will make usage even easier in the future (e.g., tracking transaction status, reloading components when a connection is established, updating the page when the network changes, and more)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Address Access

Previously, the `UserSession` class was used to access the user's addresses and data, which abstracted away the underlying implementation details.
Now, the `request` method is used to directly interact with the wallet, giving developers more explicit control and clarity over what's happening under the hood.
This manual approach makes the wallet interaction more transparent and customizable.
Developers can manually manage the currently connected user's address in e.g. local storage, jotai, etc. or use the `connect()`/`request()` method to cache the address in local storage.

### Security Note
For security reasons, the `8.x.x` release only returns the current network's address (where previously both mainnet and testnet addresses were returned).
