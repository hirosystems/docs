Clarinet and the Clarity VS Code extensions are essential for developing smart contracts. They streamline the process of writing, testing, and deploying Clarity code, enhancing your productivity and ensuring a smooth development experience.

Let's get you set up with Clarinet and configure your IDE for the best development experience.

## What you'll need

Before installing Clarinet, make sure you have:

- [x] A terminal you're comfortable with
- [x] A preferred IDE of choice (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
- [x] 5 minutes of your time

## Install Clarinet

Choose your operating system and follow the installation steps.

<TerminalPicker storage="macOs">

```terminal !! macOS
$ brew install clarinet
```

```terminal !! Windows
$ winget install clarinet
```

```terminal !! Cargo
$ sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev
```

```terminal !! Pre-built binary
$ wget -nv https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/download/v0.27.0/clarinet-linux-x64-glibc.tar.gz -O clarinet-linux-x64.tar.gz
$ tar -xf clarinet-linux-x64.tar.gz
$ chmod +x ./clarinet
$ mv ./clarinet /usr/local/bin
```

</TerminalPicker>

### Verify installation

After installation completes, verify Clarinet is working:

```terminal
$ clarinet --version
```

See a version number? You're good to go.

## Set up VS Code for Clarity

Writing Clarity code? You'll want syntax highlighting and auto-completion. Our VS Code extension transforms your editor into a smart contract development powerhouse.

### Install the Clarity extension

**From VS Code:**

1. Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`)
2. Search for "Clarity"
3. Click Install on the Hiro Systems extension

**From Command Palette:**

1. Open Quick Open (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`)
2. Paste: `ext install HiroSystems.clarity-lsp`
3. Press Enter

**From terminal:**

```terminal
$ code --install-extension hirosystems.clarity-lsp
```

The extension works in VS Code Desktop and VS Code for Web ([vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/), [github.dev](https://github.dev/)).

### What you get

With the extension installed, you'll have:

- ✓ **Smart auto-completion** - Function suggestions with placeholders
- ✓ **Documentation on hover** - Learn functions without leaving your editor
- ✓ **Go-to definition** - Navigate code across files and contract calls
- ✓ **Real-time error checking** - Catch syntax errors and warnings as you type
- ✓ **Local contract resolution** - Auto-complete across your entire project
- ✓ **Trait support** - Validates SIP-009/010 implementations
- ✓ **Visual debugger** - Step through code line-by-line (requires Clarinet)

## Configure your shell (optional)

Make your life easier with tab completion for Clarinet commands.

<TerminalPicker storage="shell-completion">

```terminal !! Bash
$ clarinet completions bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/clarinet
$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/clarinet
```

```terminal !! Zsh
$ clarinet completions zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_clarinet
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

```terminal !! Fish
$ clarinet completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/clarinet.fish
$ source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

</TerminalPicker>

Now you can type `clarinet ` and hit tab to see available commands.

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you see `command not found: clarinet`, your PATH might need updating:

<TerminalPicker storage="path-fix">

```terminal !! macOS/Linux
$ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

```terminal !! Windows
$ Run PowerShell as Administrator
$ [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Program Files\clarinet", "User")
$ Restart your terminal
```

</TerminalPicker>

### Permission denied

On Linux/macOS, you might need to make Clarinet executable:

```terminal
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/clarinet
```

### VS Code extension not working

1. Make sure you have the latest VS Code version
2. Reload the window: ⇧⌘P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux), then "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Check the extension is enabled for your workspace
