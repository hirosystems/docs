description: Query the Stacks Node RPC API, interact with smart contracts, and broadcast transactions all via a familiar REST interface.

import { SecondaryCard } from '@/components/card';

The Stacks Node RPC API allows you to query the Stacks blockchain and interact with smart contracts. Note: this is not a Hiro-maintained service. This RPC API is generated by every Stacks node and allows you to self-host your own node and API. This is a minimalist configuration. For a richer data set and an API that is easier to use, try [Hiro's Stacks Blockchain API](/stacks/api).
