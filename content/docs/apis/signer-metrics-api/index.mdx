The Signer Metrics API enables you to monitor signers on the Stacks network. With a familiar REST interface, you can easily fetch information about the signer network, such as lists of active signers in a particular PoX cycle and signer information for a particular block. 

This API also lets you analyze and evaluate the behavior of individual signers, such as their block acceptance rate, their average block push time, and more.
