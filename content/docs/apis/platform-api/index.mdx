## Overview

The Platform API provides programmatic control over Hiro Platform services through a REST interface. Built for automation and CI/CD integration, it enables you to create and manage chainhooks, control platform-hosted devnets, and interact with blockchain services directly from your application code.

## Key features

- **Chainhook automation** - Create, update, and delete chainhooks programmatically
- **Devnet control** - Start, stop, and interact with platform-hosted development networks
- **CI/CD integration** - Automate blockchain workflows in your development pipeline

## Usage

```terminal
$ curl -L 'https://api.platform.hiro.so/v1/ext/{apiKey}/chainhooks' -H 'Accept: application/json'
```
