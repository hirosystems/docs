## Usage

The Platform API is built on REST principles, enforcing HTTPS for all requests to ensure data security, integrity, and privacy.

### Base URL

```console -c
https://api.platform.hiro.so
```

### Making requests

To make a request to the Platform API, you can paste the curl command below in your terminal.

```terminal
$ curl -L 'https://api.platform.hiro.so/v1/ext/{apiKey}/chainhooks' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Authentication

The Platform API uses path-based authentication. Replace `{apiKey}` in the URL path with your Platform API key.

```terminal
$ curl -L 'https://api.platform.hiro.so/v1/ext/{apiKey}/chainhooks' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Response codes

The Platform API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate request success or failure.

| Code | Description |
