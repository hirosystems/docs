import { SecondaryCard } from '@/components/card';

The Platform API unlocks powerful automation opportunities in your application code, development and CI scripts, and more, via a familiar REST interface.

In particular, this API lets you programmatically create, update, query, and delete chainhooks as well as interact with a platform-hosted devnet from your local machine.

When you create a Platform account, you'll automatically receive an API key that's required to use these endpoints. You can also create additional API keys in the [Hiro Platform](/stacks/api-keys) as needed.
