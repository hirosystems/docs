description: The Stacks API provides you with fast, reliable data for the Stacks blockchain via an easy-to-use REST interface.
---

The Stacks API is a service that helps you with the complete ingestion of Stacks blockchain data. Using our endpoints, you can retrieve transaction data, smart contract information, account balances, block details, and more.

The Stacks API uses REST endpoints and cached responses in order to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary requests. Reliable, consistent blockchain data, one request away.
