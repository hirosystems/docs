The Runes API is a service that helps you with the complete ingestion of Bitcoin Runes data. Using our endpoints, you can retrieve metadata for a particular rune, trading activity, all runes held by a particular address, and more.

The Runes API uses REST endpoints and cached responses in order to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary requests. Reliable, consistent runes data, one request away.
