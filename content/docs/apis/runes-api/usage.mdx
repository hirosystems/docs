## Usage

The Runes API is built on REST principles, enforcing HTTPS for all requests to ensure data security, integrity, and privacy.

### Base URL

```console -c
https://api.hiro.so
```

### Making requests

To make a request to the Runes API, you can paste the curl command below in your terminal.

```terminal
$ curl -L 'https://api.hiro.so/runes/v1/etchings' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Authentication

If you are using an api-key, replace `$HIRO_API_KEY` with your secret API key.

```terminal
$ curl -L 'https://api.hiro.so/runes/v1/etchings' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: $HIRO_API_KEY'
```

## Response codes

The Runes API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate request success or failure.

| Code | Description |
