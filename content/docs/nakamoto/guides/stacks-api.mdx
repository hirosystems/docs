## What's new

<Callout title="Note" type="info">
  The `/extended/v2/*` endpoints represent the modern API that is being
  continually expanded to support the Nakamoto upgrade. We encourage developers
  to use v2 endpoints for new developments. Be aware that `/extended/v1/*` are
  the older set of endpoints. Though they continue to function alongside v2, they will be deprecated in the coming months.
</Callout>

### Nakamoto endpoints

The Stacks Blockchain API has a series of new endpoints to support the upcoming Nakamoto upgrade:

- Get Proof-of-Transfer details per Cycle, including Signers and Stackers, with information about stacked STX amounts, payout addresses and signer weights
- Get a list of Stacks blocks per Bitcoin block to support the new Nakamoto mining mechanism
- Get all transactions relevant to a STX address or contract ID, including filters for FT and NFT transfers
- Support for the new Nakamoto `tenure_change` transaction type across all our transaction endpoints
- Get a summary of current network mempool transaction fees, including statistics for expected confirmation priorities
- Get the deployment status of multiple smart contracts in one call

All of these endpoints are backwards compatible with Stacks nodes running version 2.4 or earlier

### Event replay optimizations

- Optimize replay speed by creating a new parquet-based ingestion that optimizes for canonical chain information
- Optimize classic TSV event replay by improving block ingestion times

### New transaction type `tenure_change`

This new type affects the following endpoints:

- `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/transactions`
- `/extended/v1/tx`
- `/extended/v1/tx/{tx_id}`
- `/extended/v1/tx/{tx_id}/raw`
- `/extended/v1/tx/mempool`
- `/extended/v1/tx/multiple`

### New endpoints: `/extended/v2/*`

One important difference to note between the `/extended/v1` vs the `/extended/v2` endpoints is that the ﻿/extended/v2/_ endpoints represent the current API that is being continually expanded to support the Nakamoto upgrade. We encourage developers to use v2 endpoints for new developments. Be aware that ﻿/extended/v1/_ are the older set of endpoints. Though they continue to function alongside v2, they will be deprecated in the coming months.

- `/extended/v2/mempool/fees`
- `/extended/v2/burn-blocks`
- `/extended/v2/burn-blocks/{height_or_hash}`
- `/extended/v2/burn-blocks/{height_or_hash}/blocks`
- `/extended/v2/blocks`
- `/extended/v2/blocks/{height_or_hash}`
- `/extended/v2/blocks/{height_or_hash}/transactions`
- `/extended/v2/addresses/{address}/transactions:`
- `/extended/v2/addresses/{address}/transactions/{tx_id}/events:`
- `/extended/v2/smart-contracts/status`
- `/extended/v2/pox/cycles`
- `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}`
- `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}/signers`
- `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}/signers/{signer_key}`
- `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}/signers/{signer_key}/stackers`

### Deprecated endpoints

- `/extended/v1/block`
- `/extended/v1/block/{hash}`
- `/extended/v1/block/by_height/{height}`
- `/extended/v1/block/by_burn_block_hash/{burn_block_hash}`
- `/extended/v1/block/by_burn_block_height/{burn_block_height}`
- `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/transactions`
- `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/{tx_id}/with_transfers`
- `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/transactions_with_transfers`
- `/extended/v1/fee_rate`
- `/extended/v1/tx/block/{block_hash}`
- `/extended/v1/tx/block_height/{height}`
