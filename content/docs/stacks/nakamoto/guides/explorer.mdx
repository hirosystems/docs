## What's new

### Introducing a fresh view for blocks

The Stacks Explorer now features a new way to display blocks, aligning with the Nakamoto upgrade's approach of multiple STX blocks settling into one BTC block.

<Wrapper>
  <ImageZoom
    alt="nakamoto-explorer"
    src={NakamotoExplorer}
    className="!my-0 rounded-xl bg-background"
    priority
  />
</Wrapper>

### Tailored viewing experience

This new view is now live on both [testnet](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet) and [mainnet](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=mainnet), accessible via the network dropdown.

#### Two distinctive display modes

1. **Independent Display:** Focuses on STX blocks progress.
2. **COMING SOONâ€”Grouped by Bitcoin Block:** Shows BTC blocks flow alongside STX blocks.

<Wrapper>
  <ImageZoom
    alt="group-by-block"
    src={GroupByBlock}
    className="!my-0 rounded-xl bg-background"
    priority
  />
</Wrapper>

### Stay in the loop with live view
