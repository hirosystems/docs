## Setting up a project for Nakamoto

As of [Clarinet 2.9.0](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/tag/v2.9.0), devnet can run
the latest Stacks blockchain version, enabling Nakamoto and support Clarity 3 contracts.

Once the devnet reaches the right block height, (Bitcoin block #108 by default), it will deploy the
`pox-4.clar` contract and run in Epoch 2.5. From there, Clarinet will send `stack-stx` and
`stack-extend` requests to the new PoX contract. In Nakamoto mode, devnet has 2 signers. Eventually,
you can observe the `vote-for-aggregate-public-key` transactions that they send.

By default, the Devnet will not get to Epoch 3.0 ("Nakamoto activation" with fast blocks). For that,
the `epoch_3_0` height as to be set manually in the `Devnet.toml` file. Using one of your Clarinet
projects, or a new one (with `$ clarinet new <project-name>`), update the `settings/Devnet.toml`
with the following settings:

```toml
# settings/Devnet.toml
[devnet]
epoch_3_0 = 144

stacks_node_image_url = "quay.io/hirosystems/stacks-node:devnet2.9.0-epoch3.0"
stacks_signer_image_url = "quay.io/hirosystems/stacks-signer:devnet2.9.0-epoch3.0"
```

At the end of the `Devnet.toml` file, you must make sure that the `pox_stacking_orders` are properly
set. You should have 3 stacking orders from 3 different accounts. All should start at **cycle 1**
and take at least **2 slots**. You also need to enable the auto-extends property. Becasue Nakamoto
relies on the Stackers to sign blocks, these settings ensure that there are engouh stacked STX for
each cycles. Here is what it looks like by default in new projects:

```toml
# settings/Devnet.toml
[[devnet.pox_stacking_orders]]
start_at_cycle = 1
duration = 10
auto_extend = true
wallet = "wallet_1"
slots = 2
btc_address = "mr1iPkD9N3RJZZxXRk7xF9d36gffa6exNC"

[[devnet.pox_stacking_orders]]
start_at_cycle = 1
duration = 10
auto_extend = true
wallet = "wallet_2"
slots = 2
btc_address = "muYdXKmX9bByAueDe6KFfHd5Ff1gdN9ErG"

[[devnet.pox_stacking_orders]]
start_at_cycle = 1
duration = 10
auto_extend = true
wallet = "wallet_3"
slots = 2
btc_address = "mvZtbibDAAA3WLpY7zXXFqRa3T4XSknBX7"
```

Set a contract to be deployed in epoch 3.0 with Clarity 3. You can create a new one with
`$ clarinet contract new <contract-name>`). It needs to be manually update in the project manifest
(Clarinet.toml)

```toml
# Clarinet.toml
[contracts.nakademo]
path = 'contracts/nakademo.clar'
clarity_version = 3
epoch = 3.0
```

Start devnet with `clarinet devnet start`, you should see epoch 3.0 and fast blocks at Bitcoin
block 144.
