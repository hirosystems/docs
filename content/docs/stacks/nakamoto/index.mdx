Nakamoto is an upcoming upgrade to Stacks that brings faster blocks and paves the way for sBTC. [Start here](https://docs.stacks.co/nakamoto-upgrade/nakamoto-upgrade-start-here) if you need an overview of how Nakamoto impacts the network. This document is about how Nakamoto impacts your applications and Hiro tooling specifically.

The good news for you is that the Nakamoto upgrade does not bring breaking changes to applications on Stacks. Your app will continue to work as expected post-upgrade, apart from you and your users experiencing the better UX of faster block times.

In terms of what you need to do to prepare for Nakamoto, just make sure you are running the latest versions of our tooling. We are shipping updates across all Hiro tools to make sure they support Nakamoto and that you can stay focused on building.

Below find a list of how Hiro tools have been updated to support Nakamoto:

## Stacks Explorer: What's new

### Introducing a fresh view for blocks

The Stacks Explorer now features a new way to display blocks, aligning with the Nakamoto upgrade's approach of multiple STX blocks settling into one BTC block.

### Tailored viewing experience

This new view is now live on both [testnet](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet) and [mainnet](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=mainnet), accessible via the network dropdown.

#### Two distinctive display modes

1. **Independent Display:** Focuses on STX blocks progress.
2. **COMING SOON—Grouped by Bitcoin Block:** Shows BTC blocks flow alongside STX blocks.

### Stay in the loop with live view

Keep up-to-date with blocks in real-time with our new live view option.

## Stacks.js: What’s new

### StackingClient

Install the latest nakamoto version with `npm install @stacks/stacking@6.13.0`.

The StackingClient in `@stacks/stacking` was updated to match the latest pox-4 contract.

- Added `StackingClient.signPoxSignature()`
- Added `Pox4SignatureTopic` enum
- New stacking arguments for `StackingClient.stack`, `StackingClient.stackExtend`, `StackingClient.stackIncrease`, `StackingClient.stackAggregationCommit`, and `StackingClient.stackAggregationCommitIndexed`

[Learn more](/stacks/nakamoto/guides/stacks-js) about the new Stacks.js updates.

## Clarinet: What’s new

Make sure to install [Clarinet 2.8.0](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/tag/v2.8.0) or above.

- Clarinet's devnet can now be used to test Nakamoto functionality.
- The devnet now starts 2 signer nodes in Nakamoto mode.
- Running `clarinet check --enable-clarity-wasm` now runs the current interpreter and clarity wasm side-by-side to allow comparing outputs.
- `clarinet console --enable-clarity-wasm` now automatically runs the current interpreter and clarity wasm side-by-side and logs any difference in outputs.

By default, the Devnet won't start in epoch 3.0, [see this guide](/stacks/nakamoto/guides/clarinet) to configure it.

## Stacks Blockchain API: What’s new

> **_NOTE:_**
>
> The `/extended/v2/*` endpoints represent the modern API that is being continually expanded to support the Nakamoto upgrade. We encourage developers to use v2 endpoints for new developments. Be aware that `/extended/v1/*` are the older set of endpoints. Though they continue to function alongside v2, they will be deprecated in the coming months.

### Nakamoto endpoints

The Stacks Blockchain API has a series of new endpoints to support the upcoming Nakamoto upgrade:

- Get Proof-of-Transfer details per Cycle, including Signers and Stackers, with information about stacked STX amounts, payout addresses and signer weights
- Get a list of Stacks blocks per Bitcoin block to support the new Nakamoto mining mechanism
- Get all transactions relevant to a STX address or contract ID, including filters for FT and NFT transfers
- Support for the new Nakamoto `tenure_change` transaction type across all our transaction endpoints
- Get a summary of current network mempool transaction fees, including statistics for expected confirmation priorities
- Get the deployment status of multiple smart contracts in one call

All of these endpoints are backwards compatible with Stacks nodes running version 2.4 or earlier

### Event replay optimizations

- Optimize replay speed by creating a new parquet-based ingestion that optimizes for canonical chain information
- Optimize classic TSV event replay by improving block ingestion times

### New transaction type `tenure_change`

Affects endpoints:

- `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/transactions`
- `/extended/v1/tx`
- `/extended/v1/tx/{tx_id}`
- `/extended/v1/tx/{tx_id}/raw`
- `/extended/v1/tx/mempool`
- `/extended/v1/tx/multiple`

### New endpoints: `/extended/v2/*`

- `/extended/v2/mempool/fees`
- `/extended/v2/burn-blocks`
- `/extended/v2/burn-blocks/{height_or_hash}`
- `/extended/v2/burn-blocks/{height_or_hash}/blocks`
- `/extended/v2/blocks`
- `/extended/v2/blocks/{height_or_hash}`
- `/extended/v2/blocks/{height_or_hash}/transactions`
- `/extended/v2/addresses/{address}/transactions:`
- `/extended/v2/addresses/{address}/transactions/{tx_id}/events:`
- `/extended/v2/smart-contracts/status`
- `/extended/v2/pox/cycles`
- `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}`

- `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}/signers/{signer_key}/stackers`

### Deprecated endpoints

- `/extended/v1/block/{hash}`
- `/extended/v1/block/by_height/{height}`
- `/extended/v1/block/by_burn_block_hash/{burn_block_hash}`
- `/extended/v1/block/by_burn_block_height/{burn_block_height}`
- `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/transactions`
- `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/{tx_id}/with_transfers`
