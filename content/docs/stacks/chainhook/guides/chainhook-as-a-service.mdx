title: Run Chainhook as a service
description: Learn how to run Chainhook as a service to evaluate your "if this, then that" predicates against the Bitcoin and Stacks blockchains.
---

In order to build out a more robust and secure web app, you can run Chainhook as a service to stream your events continously to a server you designate.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. [Configure an existing Bitcoin node to work with Chainhook](#configure-an-existing-bitcoin-node-to-work-with-chainhook).
2. [Generate a Chainhook predicate to target specific transactions](#generate-a-chainhook-predicate-to-target-specific-transactions).
3. [Scan the Bitcoin blockchain for transactions that match your predicate](#scan-the-bitcoin-blockchain-for-transactions-that-match-your-predicate).
4. [Initiate a Chainhook service to watch for matching transactions](#initiate-a-chainhook-service-to-watch-for-matching-transactions).
5. [Dynamically register your predicate with Chainhook](#dynamically-register-your-predicate-with-chainhook).

---

## Configure Chainhook

In this section, you will configure Chainhook to match the network configurations with the bitcoin config file. First, [install the latest version of Chainhook](/stacks/chainhook/installation).

Next, you will generate a `Chainhook.toml` file to connect Chainhook with your bitcoind node. Navigate to the directory where you want to generate the `Chainhook.toml` file and use the following command in your terminal:

```console title="Terminal"
chainhook config generate --mainnet
```

Several network parameters in the generated `Chainhook.toml` configuration file need to match those in the `bitcoin.conf` file created earlier in the [setting up a Bitcoin node](/guides/sync-a-bitcoin-node) section. Update the following parameters accordingly:

1. Update `bitcoind_rpc_username` with the username set for `rpcuser` in `bitcoin.conf`.
2. Update `bitcoind_rpc_password` with the password set for `rpcpassword` in `bitcoin.conf`.
3. Update `bitcoind_rpc_url` with the same host and port used for `rpcport` in `bitcoin.conf`.

Additionally, if you want to receive events from the configured Bitcoin node, substitute `stacks_node_rpc_url` with `bitcoind_zmq_url`, as follows:

```toml
[storage]
working_dir = "cache"

# The http API allows you to register / deregister predicates dynamically.
# This is disabled by default.

# [http_api]
# http_port = 20456
# database_uri = "redis://localhost:6379/"

[network]
mode = "mainnet"
bitcoind_rpc_url = "http://localhost:8332"
bitcoind_rpc_username = "devnet"
bitcoind_rpc_password = "devnet"
# Bitcoin block events can be received by Chainhook
# either through a Bitcoin node's ZeroMQ interface,
# or through the Stacks node. The Stacks node is
# used by default:
# stacks_node_rpc_url = "http://localhost:20443"
# but zmq can be used instead:
bitcoind_zmq_url = "tcp://0.0.0.0:18543"

[limits]
max_number_of_bitcoin_predicates = 100
max_number_of_concurrent_bitcoin_scans = 100
max_number_of_stacks_predicates = 10
max_number_of_concurrent_stacks_scans = 10
max_number_of_processing_threads = 16
max_number_of_networking_threads = 16
max_caching_memory_size_mb = 32000

[[event_source]]
tsv_file_url = "https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain-api/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-api-latest"
```

Here is a table of the relevant parameters this guide changes in our configuration files.

| bitcoin.conf    | Chainhook.toml        |
| :--------------- | :--------------------- |
| rpcuser         | bitcoind_rpc_username |
| rpcpassword     | bitcoind_rpc_password |
| rpcport         | bitcoind_rpc_url      |
| zmqpubhashblock | bitcoind_zmq_url      |

## Scan the blockchain based on predicates

Now that your `bitcoind` and Chainhook configurations are complete, you can define the Chainhook [predicate scope](/stacks/chainhook/references/scopes) you would like to scan for.

These predicates are where you specify the `if_this / then_that` pattern to trigger Chainhook to deliver a result (either a file appendation or an HTTP POST request).

## Appending events to a file

To generate a sample JSON file with predicates, execute the following command in your terminal:

```console title="Terminal"
chainhook predicates new stacking-pool.json --bitcoin
```

Replace the contents of the `stacking-pool.json` file with the following:

```json
// [!code word: file_append]
{
  "chain": "bitcoin",
  "uuid": "1",
  "name": "Stacking Pool",
  "version": 1,
  "networks": {
    "mainnet": {
      "start_block": 801500,
      "end_block": 802000,
      "if_this": {
        "scope": "outputs",
        "p2wpkh": {
          "equals": "bc1qs0kkdpsrzh3ngqgth7mkavlwlzr7lms2zv3wxe"
        }
      },
      "then_that": {
        "file_append": {
          "path": "bitcoin-transactions.txt"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates scanning a portion of the Bitcoin blockchain to capture specific outputs from a Bitcoin address associated with a Stacking pool, in this case [Friedgar Pool](https://pool.friedger.de/). Notice the `then_that` predicate specifying a `file_append`.

<Callout>
You can get blockchain height and current block by referring to the [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so/blocks?chain=mainnet).
</Callout>

Now, use the following command to scan the blocks based on the predicates defined in the `stacking-pool.json` file.

```console title="Terminal"
chainhook predicates scan stacking-pool.json --config-path=./Chainhook.toml
```

The output of the above command will be a text file `bitcoin-transactions.txt` generated based on the predicate definition.

## Sending events to an API endpoint

Now you will generate another sample predicate, but this time you will send the payload to an API endpoint:

```console title="Terminal"
chainhook predicates new stacking-pool-api.json --bitcoin
```

Replace the contents of the `stacking-pool-api.json` file with the following:

```json
// [!code word: http_post]
{
  "chain": "bitcoin",
  "uuid": "2",
  "name": "Stacking Pool (API)",
  "version": 1,
  "networks": {
    "mainnet": {
      "start_block": 801500,
      "if_this": {
        "scope": "outputs",
        "p2wpkh": {
          "equals": "bc1qs0kkdpsrzh3ngqgth7mkavlwlzr7lms2zv3wxe"
        }
      },
      "then_that": {
        "http_post": {
          "url": "http://localhost:3000/events",
          "authorization_header": "12345"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout>
The `start_block` is a required field when using the `http_post` `then_that` predicate.
</Callout>

Once you are finished setting up your endpoint, use the following command to scan the blocks based on the predicates defined in the `stacking-pool-api.json` file.

```console title="Terminal"
chainhook predicates scan stacking-pool-api.json --config-path=./Chainhook.toml
```

The above command posts events to the URL `http://localhost:3000/events`, mentioned in the JSON file.

## Initiate Chainhook service

In the examples above, your Chainhook scanned historical blockchain data against predicates and delivered results. In this next section, you will learn how to set up a Chainhook that acts as an ongoing observer and event-streaming service.

You can start a Chainhook service with an existing predicate. You can also dynamically register new predicates by making an API call to your chainhook. In both of these instances, your predicates will be delivering their results to a server set up to receive results.

Initiate the chainhook service by passing the predicate path to the command as shown below:

```console title="Terminal"
chainhook service start --predicate-path=stacking-pool-api.json --config-path=Chainhook.toml
```

The above command registers the predicate based on the predicate definition in the `stacking-pool-api.json` file.

## Dynamically register predicates

You can also dynamically register new predicates with your Chainhook service. This means you can start a long-running process that exposes HTTP endpoints to register, deregister, and report on new predicates.

<Callout title="Requirements" type="warn">
This section requires that you have Redis running locally. To install, refer to the [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/).
</Callout>

First, ensure that the following lines of code are uncommented in the `Chainhook.toml` file to enable the predicate registration server:

```toml
[http_api]
http_port = 20456
database_uri = "redis://localhost:6379/"
```

If you have an instance of Redis running locally, you can now start the Chainhook service by running the following command:

```console title="Terminal"
chainhook service start --config-path=Chainhook.toml
```

To dynamically register a new predicate, send a POST request to the running predicate registration server at `localhost:20456/v1/chainhooks`.

```console title="Terminal"
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chain": "bitcoin",
    "uuid": "3",
    "name": "Ordinals",
    "version": 1,
    "networks": {
      "mainnet": {
        "start_block": 777534,
        "if_this": {
          "scope": "ordinals_protocol",
          "operation": "inscription_feed"
        },
        "then_that": {
          "http_post": {
            "url": "http://localhost:3000/events",
            "authorization_header": "12345"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }' \
  http://localhost:20456/v1/chainhooks
```

The sample response should look like this:

```jsonc
{
  "chainhook": {
    "predicate": {
      "operation": "inscription_feed",
      "scope": "ordinals_protocol",
    },
    "uuid": "1",
  },
  "apply": [
    {

        "index": 777533,
      },
      "timestamp": 1676923039,
      "transactions": [
        {
          "transaction_identifier": {

          },
          "metadata": {
            "ordinal_operations": [
              {
                "inscription_revealed": {
                  "content_bytes": "<INSCRIPTION_BYTES>",
                  "content_length": 12293,
                  "content_type": "image/jpeg",
                  "inscriber_address": "bc1punnjva5ayg84kf5tmvx265uwvp8py3ux24skz43aycj5rzdgzjfq0jxsuc",
                  "inscription_fee": 64520,
                  "inscription_id": "ca20efe5e4d71c16cd9b8dfe4d969efdd225ef0a26136a6a4409cb3afb2e013ei0",
                  "inscription_number": 0,
                  "inscription_output_value": 10000,
                  "ordinal_block_height": 543164,
                  "ordinal_number": 1728956147664701,
                  "ordinal_offset": 1147664701,
                  "satpoint_post_inscription": "ca20efe5e4d71c16cd9b8dfe4d969efdd225ef0a26136a6a4409cb3afb2e013e:0:0",
                  "transfers_pre_inscription": 0,
                },
              },
            ],
            "proof": null,
          },
          "operations": [],
          // Other transactions
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
  "rollback": [],
}
```

To better understand the output of the above JSON file, let's break down some of the details:

- The `apply` payload includes the block header and the transactions that triggered the predicate.
- The `rollback` payload includes the block header and the transactions that triggered the predicate for a past block that is no longer part of the canonical chain and must be reverted. (Note: this is a chief component of Chainhook's reorg-aware functionality. Chainhook maintains rollback data for blocks near the chaintip.)

<Callout>
You can also run chainhook service by passing multiple predicates, ie `chainhook service start --predicate-path=predicate_1.json --predicate-path=predicate_2.json --config-path=Chainhook.toml`
</Callout>
