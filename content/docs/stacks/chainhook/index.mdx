Chainhook is a reorg-aware indexer that serves reliable blockchain data—you don’t have to waste time reindexing your database every time there's a fork. Chainhook also lets you index only the data you need, which means you can build lighter databases, get faster query results, and deliver a better experience to your users.

To get started, check out our [installation guide](/stacks/chainhook/installation).
