title: Predicate design
description: Predicates are the building blocks of Chainhook.
---

The core design of chainhooks revolves around the concept of predicates. Each individual chainhook has a customizable predicate that specifies what information you are scanning for.

Predicates are defined in an `if-this`, `then-that` format. You'll write your condition in the `if-this` condition template and use `then-that` to output the result.

## `if-this`

The `if-this` predicate design can use the following attributes to define the predicates. The 'scope' parameter is mandatory to use with any other parameters.

```json
// [!code word:if_this]
{
  "if_this": {
    "scope": "txid",
    "equals": "0xfaaac1833dc4883e7ec28f61e35b41f896c395f8d288b1a177155de2abd6052f"
  }
}
```

Other available parameters:

- `equals`
- `op_return`
- `ends_with`
- `p2pkh`
- `p2sh`
- `p2wpkh`
- `operation`

</Callout>

## `then-that`

The `then-that` predicate design can use the following attributes to output the result based on the `if-this` condition defined.

```jsonc
// [!code word:file_append]
{
  "then_that": {
    "file_append": {
      "path": "/tmp/events.json",
    },
  },
}
```

```jsonc
// [!code word:http_post]
{
  "then_that": {
    "http_post": {
      "url": "https://example.com/api/v1/events",
      "authorization_header": "Bearer 1234567890"
    }
  }
}
```
