Typically, we speak of `mainnet` and `testnet` as the networks of Stacks. Most wallets will be configured to `mainnet` by default—this is the production environment, the actual blockchain that holds real STX tokens.

As the name suggests, `testnet` is a public network for testing. It's a separate blockchain state that holds test tokens, which have no value.

Developers are encouraged to use `StacksTestnet` for testing before rolling out applications and contracts to `StacksMainnet`.
There is even `StacksDevnet` and `StacksMocknet` for working in a local development environment for development.
Stacks.js functions can be configured to use whichever network you want.

You can learn more about devnet [here](/stacks/clarinet/guides/run-a-local-devnet).

## Create a network instance

```ts twoslash
import { StacksMainnet, StacksTestnet } from '@stacks/network';

const mainnet = new StacksMainnet();
const testnet = new StacksTestnet();
```

The constructors can also be passed a custom URL to an API, if you want to use a different API than the default.

```ts twoslash
import { StacksMainnet } from '@stacks/network';

const network = new StacksMainnet({
  url: 'https://www.mystacksnode.com/',
});
```
