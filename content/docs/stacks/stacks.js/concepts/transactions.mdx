The following shows how to create a simple transaction (STX transfer) using Stacks.js in different environments.

## Create a transaction

<Tabs items={['Using Connect', 'Using a mnemonic']}>
  <Tab value="Using Connect">
  ```js
    import { openSTXTransfer } from '@stacks/connect';
    import { StacksTestnet } from '@stacks/network';
    import { AnchorMode } from '@stacks/transactions';

    openSTXTransfer({
      network: new StacksTestnet(),

      recipient: 'ST39MJ145BR6S8C315AG2BD61SJ16E208P1FDK3AK', // which address you are sending to
      amount: 10000, // tokens, denominated in micro-STX
      anchorMode: AnchorMode.Any,

      onFinish: response => console.log(response.txid),
      onCancel: () => console.log('User canceled'),
    });
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Using a mnemonic">
    For full manual transaction signing, you need to provide the sender's private key.
    Treat the private key as a secret and *never* expose it to the public.

    ```js
    import { makeSTXTokenTransfer } from '@stacks/transactions';

    const tx = await makeSTXTokenTransfer({
      recipient: 'ST39MJ145BR6S8C315AG2BD61SJ16E208P1FDK3AK', // which address you are sending to
      amount: 10000, // tokens, denominated in micro-STX
      anchorMode: 'any',
      senderKey: 'c3a2d3...0b1c2', // private key (typically derived from a mnemonic)
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
