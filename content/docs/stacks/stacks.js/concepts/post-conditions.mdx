title: Post-conditions
---

In Stacks, transactions can have *post-conditions*.

These offer additional security to ensure a transaction was executed as expected.

More precisely, adding post-conditions to a transaction can ensure that:

- STX tokens were transferred from an address
- FTs/NFTs were transferred from an address

<Callout type="warn">
Post-conditions aren't perfect. They can't say anything about the end-state after a transaction. In other words, they can't guarantee the receipt of FTs/NFTs, since they only check for sending.
</Callout>

Here's an example of a post-condition where the `principal` must send 1000 uSTX, or else the transaction will abort:

```js
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const tx = await makeContractCall({
  // ...
  postConditions: [
    Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6').willSendEq(1000).ustx(),
  ],
});
```

### Post-condition mode

In addition to the post-condition itself, we can also specify a `mode` for the transaction to verify asset transfers.
The mode can be either `Allow` or `Deny`.

- `Allow` means that the transaction can transfer any asset (assuming no conflicting post-conditions).
- `Deny` means the transaction will fail if any asset transfers (not specified in the post-conditions) are attempted.

<Callout>
In either case, all post-conditions will still be checked.
By default, transactions are set to `Deny` mode for additional security.
