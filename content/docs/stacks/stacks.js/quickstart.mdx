In this quickstart guide, you will learn how to build a transaction to transfer STX tokens using Stacks.js.

Check out the [reference page](/stacks/stacks.js/packages/transactions) for `@stacks/transactions` to learn more about building different types of transactions.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install packages
  
    Add the `@stacks/transactions` and `@stacks/network` packages to your project using your preferred package manager.

    ```package-install title="Terminal"
    @stacks/transactions @stacks/network
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Build the transaction for a STX transfer
  
    To set up a STX token transfer transaction, use the `makeSTXTokenTransfer` function.

    This function requires a private key (`senderKey`), a specified `network`, and the details of the transfer.

    ```ts stx-transfer.ts -cn
    import { makeSTXTokenTransfer } from "@stacks/transactions";
    import { STACKS_TESTNET } from "@stacks/network";

    const transaction = await makeSTXTokenTransfer({
      recipient: "ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5",
      amount: 42000000,
      senderKey:
        "753b7cc01a1a2e86221266a154af739463fce51219d97e4f856cd7200c3bd2a601",
      network: STACKS_TESTNET,
    });
    ```

    There are a few optional fields for a STX transfer transaction, including `memo`, `nonce`, and `fee`.

    <Accordions>
      <Accordion title="Optional fields example">
      ```ts
      const transaction = await makeSTXTokenTransfer({
        // ...other fields ommitted
        memo: "test memo",
        nonce: 0n,
        fee: 200n,
      });
      ```
      </Accordion>
    </Accordions>

    <Callout>
      Use `memo` to add a message as part of the transaction. If you don't want the builder to fetch the `nonce` and `fee` from a Stacks node, you can manually set these fields.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Broadcast the transaction
  
    Once you've constructed a valid transaction, you can broadcast it to the network using the `broadcastTransaction` function.

    ```ts stx-transfer.ts -cn
    // !mark[/broadcastTransaction/mg]
    import { broadcastTransaction,makeSTXTokenTransfer } from "@stacks/transactions";
    import { STACKS_TESTNET } from "@stacks/network";

    const transaction = await makeSTXTokenTransfer({
      recipient: "ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5",
      amount: 42000000,
      senderKey:
        "753b7cc01a1a2e86221266a154af739463fce51219d97e4f856cd7200c3bd2a601",
      network: STACKS_TESTNET,
    });

    const broadcastResponse = await broadcastTransaction({ transaction });
    const txId = broadcastResponse.txid;
    ```

    Upon success, this will return a `StacksTransaction` object that contains information about the transaction, including the `txid`.
