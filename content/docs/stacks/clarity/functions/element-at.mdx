title: element-at?
description: Retrieving an element from a list at a specific index in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(element-at? list-expr uint)
```

- Input: 
  - `list-expr`: A list expression
  - `uint`: An unsigned integer representing the index
- Output: `(optional A)` where A is the type of elements in the list

## Why it matters

The `element-at?` function is crucial for:

1. Safely accessing elements in a list at a specific index.
2. Handling potential out-of-bounds access without causing errors.
3. Implementing logic that depends on retrieving specific elements from lists.
4. Providing a way to work with lists in a more flexible manner.

## When to use it

Use `element-at?` when you need to:

- Retrieve a specific element from a list by its position.
- Implement algorithms that require access to list elements by index.
- Safely handle potential out-of-bounds access in list operations.
- Work with lists in a way that may involve accessing elements at varying positions.

## Best Practices

- Always check the returned optional value to handle cases where the index is out of bounds.
- Use in combination with `len` to ensure you're not attempting to access beyond the list's length.
- Consider using `map` or `fold` for operations that need to process all elements instead of accessing by index.
- Be mindful of the zero-based indexing when using `element-at?`.

## Practical Example: Retrieving a Specific Item

Let's implement a function that retrieves an item from a todo list:

```clarity
(define-data-var todo-list (list 10 (string-ascii 50)) (list))

(define-public (add-todo (item (string-ascii 50)))
  (let ((current-list (var-get todo-list)))
    (if (< (len current-list) u10)
        (ok (var-set todo-list (append current-list item)))
        (err u1))))

(define-read-only (get-todo (index uint))
  (match (element-at? (var-get todo-list) index)
    item (ok item)
    (err u404)))

;; Usage
(add-todo "Buy milk")
(add-todo "Walk the dog")
(get-todo u1) ;; Returns (ok "Walk the dog")
(get-todo u5) ;; Returns (err u404)
```




This example demonstrates:
1. Using `element-at?` to retrieve an item from a list stored in a data variable.
2. Handling the optional return value with `match` to provide meaningful responses.
3. Safely accessing list elements without risking out-of-bounds errors.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting that list indices are zero-based in Clarity.
2. Not handling the case where `element-at?` returns `none` for out-of-bounds access.
3. Using `element-at?` in a loop to process all elements, which is less efficient than using `map` or `fold`.

## Related Functions

- `list`: Used to create lists that can be accessed with `element-at?`.
- `len`: Often used in conjunction with `element-at?` to check list bounds.
- `map`: An alternative for processing all elements in a list.
- `fold`: Another alternative for reducing a list to a single value.

## Clarity 1 Version: element-at

In Clarity 1, this function was named `element-at` (without the question mark) and had a slightly different behavior:

```clarity
(element-at list-expr uint)
```

The key differences are:
1. It returns the element directly, not wrapped in an optional.
2. It throws a runtime error if the index is out of bounds.

When migrating from Clarity 1 to newer versions, replace `element-at` with `element-at?` and add appropriate error handling for out-of-bounds cases.

## Conclusion

The `element-at?` function is a safer and more flexible way to access list elements in Clarity smart contracts compared to its predecessor. By returning an optional value, it allows developers to handle out-of-bounds access gracefully, leading to more robust and error-resistant code. When working with lists in Clarity, `element-at?` is an essential tool for accessing specific elements while maintaining the integrity and safety of your contract operations.
