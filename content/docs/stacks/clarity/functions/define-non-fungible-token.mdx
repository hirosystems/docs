description: Defining a new non-fungible token class in Clarity smart contracts.

## Function Signature

```clarity
(define-non-fungible-token asset-name asset-identifier-type)
```

- Input: 
  - `asset-name`: The name of the non-fungible token class
  - `asset-identifier-type`: The type of the unique identifier for each token
- Output: Not applicable (definition statement)

## Why it matters

The `define-non-fungible-token` function is crucial for:

1. Creating new non-fungible token (NFT) classes within a smart contract.
2. Establishing unique digital assets with individual identifiers.
3. Implementing collectibles, digital art, or other unique token-based systems.
4. Enabling NFT-related operations like minting, transferring, and ownership checks.

## When to use it

Use `define-non-fungible-token` when you need to:

- Create a new NFT class for your smart contract or dApp.
- Implement unique digital assets with distinct identifiers.
- Establish a foundation for NFT-based features in your contract.
- Create collectibles, digital art tokens, or other unique digital assets.

## Best Practices

- Place `define-non-fungible-token` at the top level of your contract, as it's a definition statement.
- Choose an appropriate asset identifier type that ensures uniqueness for each token.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for your NFT classes.
- Consider the scalability and gas costs associated with your chosen identifier type.

## Practical Example: Simple Digital Art NFT

Let's implement a basic digital art NFT system:

```clarity
(define-non-fungible-token SharkoBarko uint)

(define-data-var index uint u0)

(define-public (mint (who principal) (artwork-uri (string-utf8 256)))
  (let
    (
      (tokenId (var-get index))
    )
    (try! (nft-mint? SharkoBarko tokenId who))
    (var-set index (+ tokenId u1))
    (ok tokenId)
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-owner (tokenId uint))
  (ok (nft-get-owner? SharkoBarko tokenId))
)

(define-public (transfer (tokenId uint) (sender principal) (recipient principal))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender sender) (err u403))
    (nft-transfer? SharkoBarko tokenId sender recipient)
  )
)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `define-non-fungible-token` to create a new NFT class for digital artwork.
2. Implementing basic NFT operations like minting, checking ownership, and transferring.
3. Using a simple incrementing integer as the token identifier.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting that each token in an NFT class must have a unique identifier.
2. Not implementing proper access controls for minting and transferring operations.
3. Choosing an identifier type that may lead to collisions or scalability issues.

## Related Functions

- `nft-mint?`: Used to create new tokens within the NFT class.
- `nft-transfer?`: Used to transfer ownership of an NFT.
- `nft-get-owner?`: Used to check the current owner of an NFT.
- `nft-burn?`: Used to destroy an existing NFT.

## Conclusion

The `define-non-fungible-token` function is a fundamental building block for creating NFT-based systems in Clarity smart contracts. It allows developers to define custom non-fungible token classes with unique identifiers. When combined with other NFT-related functions, it enables the implementation of sophisticated systems for digital collectibles, art, and other unique digital assets on the Stacks blockchain.
