description: Querying the STX balance of a principal in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(stx-get-balance owner)
```

- Input: `principal`
- Output: `uint`

## Why it matters

The `stx-get-balance` function is crucial for:

1. Querying the STX balance of a principal.
2. Implementing logic that requires checking account balances.
3. Ensuring data integrity by providing accurate balance information.
4. Simplifying the process of handling balance-related operations in smart contracts.

## When to use it

Use `stx-get-balance` when you need to:

- Query the STX balance of a principal.
- Implement logic that requires checking account balances.
- Ensure accurate balance information for data integrity.
- Handle balance-related operations in your smart contract.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the `principal` is correctly formatted and valid.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other account functions for comprehensive account management.
- Handle the possible error cases to ensure robust contract behavior.

## Practical Example: Querying STX Balance

Let's implement a function that queries the STX balance of a given principal:

```clarity
(define-public (get-stx-balance (account principal))
  (stx-get-balance account)
)

;; Usage
(get-stx-balance 'SZ2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKQ9H6DPR) 
;; Returns u0 if the account has no balance
(get-stx-balance (as-contract tx-sender)) 
;; Returns the balance of the contract's principal
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `stx-get-balance` to query the STX balance of a principal.
2. Implementing a public function to handle the balance query.
3. Handling both successful and error cases.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `stx-get-balance` with an incorrectly formatted or invalid `principal`, causing the operation to fail.
2. Assuming the balance query will always succeed, leading to unhandled error cases.
3. Not handling all possible conditions, resulting in incomplete account management.
4. Overlooking the need for proper error handling and validation.

## Related Functions

- `stx-transfer?`: Transfers STX from one principal to another.
- `stx-burn?`: Burns STX from a principal's account.
- `stx-account`: Queries detailed STX account information.

## Conclusion

The `stx-get-balance` function is a fundamental tool for querying the STX balance of a principal in Clarity smart contracts. It allows developers to implement logic that requires checking account balances, ensuring data integrity and simplifying balance-related operations. When used effectively, `stx-get-balance` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to handle balance queries.
