title: begin
description: Using the begin function to evaluate multiple expressions in sequence in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(begin expr1 expr2 expr3 ... expr-last)
```


- Input: Two or more expressions of any type
- Output: The value of the last expression

## Why it matters

The `begin` function is crucial for:

1. Grouping multiple expressions into a single expression.
2. Executing a series of operations in a specific order.
3. Creating complex logic flows within functions or conditions.
4. Allowing side effects while returning a specific value.

## When to use it

Use the `begin` function when you need to:

- Perform multiple operations in sequence within a single expression.
- Execute side effects before returning a final value.
- Group multiple expressions where only one is allowed (e.g., in function bodies or condition branches).
- Create more complex, multi-step logic within your smart contract functions.

## Best Practices

- Use `begin` to keep related operations together for better readability.
- Ensure that any expressions that return a response type (ok or err) are properly checked.
- Be mindful of the order of expressions, as they are evaluated sequentially.
- Use `begin` to make your code more expressive and easier to understand.

## Practical Example: User Registration with Logging

Let's implement a simple user registration function that performs multiple actions:

```clarity
(define-map Users principal bool)
(define-data-var userCount uint u0)

(define-public (register-user)
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-none (map-get? Users tx-sender)) (err u1))
    (map-set Users tx-sender true)
    (var-set userCount (+ (var-get userCount) u1))
    (print { registered: true, user: tx-sender })
    (ok true)
  )
)

;; Usage
(register-user) ;; Returns (ok true) and logs the new user
```


This example demonstrates:
1. Using `begin` to group multiple operations in a single function.
2. Performing checks, updates, and logging in a specific order.
3. Executing side effects (printing) before returning the final value.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting to return a value in the last expression of a `begin` block.
2. Not properly handling responses from functions that return (ok) or (err) within the `begin` block.
3. Relying on side effects of earlier expressions without considering their order of execution.

## Related Functions

- `let`: Used for creating local bindings within a limited scope.
- `asserts!`: Often used within `begin` blocks for condition checking.
- `print`: Useful for logging within `begin` blocks during development.

## Conclusion

The `begin` function is a fundamental tool in Clarity for grouping multiple expressions and creating more complex logic flows. By allowing developers to execute a series of operations in a specific order while returning a single value, `begin` enhances the expressiveness and capability of Clarity smart contracts. When used judiciously, it can significantly improve code readability and organization.
