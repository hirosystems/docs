title: define-data-var
description: Defining mutable variables in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(define-data-var name type value)
```

- Input: 
  - `name`: The name of the variable
  - `type`: The type of the variable
  - `value`: The initial value of the variable
- Output: Not applicable (definition statement)

## Why it matters

The `define-data-var` function is crucial for:

1. Creating mutable state variables that can be updated throughout the contract's lifecycle.
2. Storing and managing changeable data within the smart contract.
3. Implementing counters, flags, or other dynamic values that need to be modified.
4. Maintaining contract-wide state that can be accessed and modified by multiple functions.

## When to use it

Use `define-data-var` when you need to:

- Create a variable that will change its value during contract execution.
- Implement a counter or accumulator that needs to be updated.
- Store temporary or intermediate state that may be modified by contract functions.
- Maintain configurable parameters that can be updated by authorized parties.

## Best Practices

- Use `define-data-var` for values that need to change; for immutable values, use `define-constant` instead.
- Initialize variables with meaningful default values.
- Consider access control for functions that modify important data variables.
- Use clear and descriptive names for your variables to enhance readability.

## Practical Example: Simple Counter

Let's implement a basic counter using `define-data-var`:

```clarity
(define-data-var counter uint u0)

(define-public (increment)
  (begin
    (var-set counter (+ (var-get counter) u1))
    (ok (var-get counter))
  )
)

(define-public (decrement)
  (begin
    (asserts! (> (var-get counter) u0) (err u"Counter cannot be negative"))
    (var-set counter (- (var-get counter) u1))
    (ok (var-get counter))
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-counter)
  (ok (var-get counter))
)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `define-data-var` to create a mutable counter.
2. Implementing functions to increment and decrement the counter.
3. Using `var-get` and `var-set` to read and modify the variable's value.
4. Adding a safety check to prevent the counter from becoming negative.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting that `define-data-var` creates mutable state, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not managed carefully.
2. Not considering the initial value's impact on contract logic, especially if the contract relies on the variable's state.
3. Overusing mutable variables when constants or maps might be more appropriate for the use case.

## Related Functions

- `var-get`: Used to retrieve the current value of a data variable.
- `var-set`: Used to update the value of a data variable.
- `define-constant`: Used for defining immutable values.
- `define-map`: Used for defining key-value stores when more complex data structures are needed.

## Conclusion

The `define-data-var` function is essential for creating mutable state in Clarity smart contracts. It allows developers to implement dynamic behavior and maintain changeable data throughout the contract's lifecycle. When used judiciously, data variables can greatly enhance the functionality and flexibility of smart contracts. However, developers should be mindful of the implications of mutable state and ensure proper access control and error handling when modifying these variables.
