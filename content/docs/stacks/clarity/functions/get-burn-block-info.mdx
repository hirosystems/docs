description: Fetching information about burnchain blocks in Clarity smart contracts.

## Function Signature

```clarity
(get-burn-block-info? prop-name block-height)
```

- Input: 
  - `prop-name`: A BurnBlockInfoPropertyName
  - `block-height`: A uint representing the burnchain block height
- Output: `(optional buff) | (optional (tuple (addrs (list 2 (tuple (hashbytes (buff 32)) (version (buff 1))))) (payout uint)))`

## Why it matters

The `get-burn-block-info?` function is crucial for:

1. Accessing historical data from the underlying burnchain (Bitcoin).
2. Implementing cross-chain verification or logic based on Bitcoin block information.
3. Retrieving PoX (Proof of Transfer) related data for advanced stacking operations.
4. Enabling contracts to react to or validate burnchain events.

## When to use it

Use `get-burn-block-info?` when you need to:

- Verify Bitcoin block hashes within your Stacks contract.
- Access information about PoX payouts and addresses.
- Implement logic that depends on burnchain block data.
- Build cross-chain applications that reference Bitcoin state.

## Best Practices

- Always check if the returned value is `none`, as it will be for non-existent or future blocks.
- Be aware of the potential for chain reorganizations when using recent block data.
- Use the appropriate property name for the data you need to retrieve.
- Consider caching results for frequently accessed block information to save on execution costs.

## Practical Example: Verifying a Bitcoin Block Hash

Let's implement a function that verifies if a given Bitcoin block hash matches a specific height:

```clarity
(define-read-only (verify-btc-block-hash (height uint) (expected-hash (buff 32)))
  (match (get-burn-block-info? header-hash height)
    hash (is-eq hash expected-hash)
    false))

;; Usage
(verify-btc-block-hash u700000 0x00000000000000000009a11b3972c8e532e964e262c196556bd958b7fd0c55c3)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `get-burn-block-info?` to retrieve the `header-hash` of a burnchain block.
2. Handling the optional return value with `match`.
3. Comparing the retrieved hash with an expected value.

## Available Properties

- `header-hash`: Returns a 32-byte buffer representing the header hash of the burnchain block.
- `pox-addrs`: Returns a tuple containing PoX payout information:
  - `addrs`: A list of up to two PoX addresses that received payouts.
  - `payout`: The amount of burnchain tokens paid to each address.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming all properties are available for all blocks.
2. Not handling the `none` case when the block height is invalid or in the future.
3. Misinterpreting the `pox-addrs` data, especially during different PoX phases.
4. Overlooking the fact that burn addresses may be included in the `pox-addrs` list.

## Related Functions

- `get-block-info?`: Used to get information about Stacks blocks.
- `burn-block-height`: Keyword that returns the current burn chain block height.

## Conclusion

The `get-burn-block-info?` function is a powerful tool for accessing burnchain data in Clarity smart contracts. It allows developers to incorporate Bitcoin blockchain information into their contract logic, enabling cross-chain verification and advanced PoX-related functionalities. When used correctly, it provides valuable insights into the underlying Bitcoin blockchain's state and can be used to implement sophisticated, cross-chain aware contract behaviors.
