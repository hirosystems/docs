title: ft-get-balance
description: Retrieving the balance of a fungible token for a principal in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(ft-get-balance token-name principal)
```

- Input: 
  - `token-name`: The name of the fungible token
  - `principal`: The principal whose balance to check
- Output: `uint`

## Why it matters

The `ft-get-balance` function is crucial for:

1. Querying the current balance of a fungible token for any principal.
2. Implementing balance checks before transfers or other token operations.
3. Providing transparency and visibility into token holdings.
4. Enabling other contracts or off-chain applications to verify token balances.

## When to use it

Use `ft-get-balance` when you need to:

- Check a user's token balance before performing operations.
- Implement balance-dependent logic in your contract.
- Provide balance information to users or other contracts.
- Verify sufficient funds for token transfers or burns.

## Best Practices

- Use `ft-get-balance` before attempting transfers to ensure sufficient balance.
- Consider caching balance results if queried frequently to optimize gas usage.
- Be aware that balances can change between checks and actual token operations.
- Use in combination with other ft-* functions for comprehensive token management.

## Practical Example: Balance Check Before Transfer

Let's implement a function that checks balance before transferring tokens:

```clarity
(define-fungible-token my-token)

(define-public (transfer-if-sufficient (amount uint) (recipient principal))
  (let ((sender-balance (ft-get-balance my-token tx-sender)))
    (if (>= sender-balance amount)
        (ft-transfer? my-token amount tx-sender recipient)
        (err u1))))

;; Usage
(ft-mint? my-token u100 tx-sender)
(transfer-if-sufficient u50 'SPAXYA5XS51713FDTQ8H94EJ4V579CXMTRNBZKSF) ;; Returns (ok true)
(ft-get-balance my-token tx-sender) ;; Returns u50
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `ft-get-balance` to check the sender's balance before attempting a transfer.
2. Implementing a conditional transfer based on the balance check.
3. Combining `ft-get-balance` with other ft-* functions for token management.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming balances remain constant between checking and performing operations.
2. Not handling the case where a principal might not have any balance (returns 0).
3. Overusing `ft-get-balance` in loops, which can be inefficient for gas consumption.

## Related Functions

- `ft-transfer?`: Used to transfer tokens between principals.
- `ft-mint?`: Used to create new tokens, increasing the balance of a principal.
- `ft-burn?`: Used to destroy tokens, decreasing the balance of a principal.
- `ft-get-supply`: Used to get the current total supply of tokens.

## Conclusion

The `ft-get-balance` function is a fundamental tool for managing fungible tokens in Clarity smart contracts. It provides a straightforward way to query token balances, enabling developers to implement robust token-based systems with proper balance checks and validations. When used effectively in combination with other token functions, it ensures the integrity and accuracy of token operations within your smart contracts.
