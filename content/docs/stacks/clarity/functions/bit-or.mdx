title: bit-or
description: Using the bit-or function for bitwise OR operations in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(bit-or i1 i2...)
```

- Input: Two or more integers (`int` or `uint`)
- Output: An integer of the same type as the inputs (`int` or `uint`)

## Why it matters

The `bit-or` function is crucial for:

1. Performing bitwise OR operations in smart contracts.
2. Combining flags or bitmasks efficiently.
3. Implementing certain logical operations and algorithms.
4. Manipulating binary data at the bit level.

## When to use it

Use the `bit-or` function when you need to:

- Combine multiple flags or bitmasks into a single value.
- Set specific bits in an integer without affecting others.
- Implement certain bitwise algorithms or data structures.
- Perform low-level data manipulations involving binary operations.

## Best Practices

- Ensure all input values are of the same type (either all `int` or all `uint`).
- Remember that `bit-or` with `0` has no effect, which can be useful for conditional operations.
- Use `bit-or` in combination with other bitwise operations for complex bit manipulations.
- Consider readability when using bitwise operations extensively; add comments to explain the purpose.

## Practical Example: Permission System

Let's implement a simple permission system using `bit-or` and other bitwise operations:

```clarity
(define-constant PERMISSION_READ u1)    ;; 0001
(define-constant PERMISSION_WRITE u2)   ;; 0010
(define-constant PERMISSION_EXECUTE u4) ;; 0100
(define-constant PERMISSION_ADMIN u8)   ;; 1000

(define-map user-permissions principal uint)

(define-public (grant-permission (user principal) (permission uint))
  (let ((current-permissions (default-to u0 (map-get? user-permissions user))))
    (ok (map-set user-permissions user (bit-or current-permissions permission)))))

(define-public (revoke-permission (user principal) (permission uint))
  (let ((current-permissions (default-to u0 (map-get? user-permissions user))))
    (ok (map-set user-permissions user (bit-and current-permissions (bit-not permission))))))

(define-read-only (has-permission (user principal) (permission uint))
  (let ((user-permission (default-to u0 (map-get? user-permissions user))))
    (is-eq permission (bit-and user-permission permission))))

;; Usage
(grant-permission tx-sender (bit-or PERMISSION_READ PERMISSION_WRITE))
(has-permission tx-sender PERMISSION_READ) ;; Returns true
(has-permission tx-sender PERMISSION_EXECUTE) ;; Returns false
```



This example demonstrates:
1. Using `bit-or` to combine multiple permissions into a single value.
2. Implementing a permission system using bitwise operations for efficient storage and checks.
3. Combining `bit-or` with other bitwise operations like `bit-and` and `bit-not` for complex permission management.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Mixing signed (`int`) and unsigned (`uint`) integers in a single `bit-or` operation.
2. Forgetting that `bit-or` with all bits set (`-1` for `int`, maximum value for `uint`) always results in all bits set.
3. Not considering the full range of bits when using `bit-or` with smaller integer values.

## Related Functions

- `bit-and`: Used for bitwise AND operations.
- `bit-xor`: Used for bitwise XOR operations.
- `bit-not`: Used for bitwise NOT operations.
- `bit-shift-left`: Used for left-shifting bits.
- `bit-shift-right`: Used for right-shifting bits.

## Conclusion

The `bit-or` function is a powerful tool for bitwise operations in Clarity smart contracts. When used in combination with other bitwise functions, it enables efficient implementation of flags, permissions, and other bit-level data manipulations. Developers should be mindful of the types of integers used and the effects of the operation on the full range of bits to avoid unexpected results.
