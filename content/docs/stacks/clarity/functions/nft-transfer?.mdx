title: nft-transfer?
description: Transferring ownership of a non-fungible token (NFT) in Clarity smart contracts.

## Function Signature

```clarity
(nft-transfer? asset-class asset-identifier sender recipient)
```

- Input: `AssetName, A, principal, principal`
- Output: `(response bool uint)`

## Why it matters

The `nft-transfer?` function is crucial for:

1. Changing the ownership of a non-fungible token (NFT).
2. Implementing logic that depends on the transfer of NFTs.
3. Ensuring data integrity by updating ownership records.
4. Simplifying the process of transferring NFTs in smart contracts.

## When to use it

Use `nft-transfer?` when you need to:

- Change the ownership of an NFT.
- Implement logic that depends on the transfer of NFTs.
- Update ownership records in your smart contract.
- Handle NFT transfer operations.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the `sender` principal owns the NFT before attempting to transfer it.
- Ensure the `sender` and `recipient` are different principals.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other NFT functions for comprehensive NFT management.
- Handle the possible error cases to ensure robust contract behavior.

## Practical Example: Transferring an NFT

Let's implement a function that transfers an NFT from the sender to the recipient:

```clarity
(define-non-fungible-token stackaroo (string-ascii 40))

(define-public (transfer-nft (id (string-ascii 40)) (recipient principal))
  (nft-transfer? stackaroo id tx-sender recipient)
)

;; Usage
(nft-mint? stackaroo "Roo" tx-sender) ;; Returns (ok true)
(transfer-nft "Roo" 'SPAXYA5XS51713FDTQ8H94EJ4V579CXMTRNBZKSF) ;; Returns (ok true)
(nft-transfer? stackaroo "Roo" tx-sender 'SPAXYA5XS51713FDTQ8H94EJ4V579CXMTRNBZKSF) ;; Returns (err u1) because the sender no longer owns the asset
(nft-transfer? stackaroo "NonExistent" tx-sender 'SPAXYA5XS51713FDTQ8H94EJ4V579CXMTRNBZKSF) ;; Returns (err u2) because the asset does not exist
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `nft-transfer?` to transfer an NFT from the sender to the recipient.
2. Implementing a public function to handle the transfer operation.
3. Handling both the successful transfer and the case where the sender no longer owns the asset.
4. Handling the case where the asset does not exist.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `nft-transfer?` without ensuring the `sender` owns the NFT, causing the operation to fail.
2. Assuming the `sender` and `recipient` are the same principal, leading to an invalid transfer.
3. Not handling all possible conditions, resulting in incomplete NFT management.
4. Overlooking the need for proper error handling and validation.

## Related Functions

- `nft-mint?`: Mints a new non-fungible token.
- `nft-get-owner?`: Retrieves the owner of a non-fungible token.
- `nft-burn?`: Burns a non-fungible token.

## Conclusion

The `nft-transfer?` function is a fundamental tool for transferring ownership of non-fungible tokens in Clarity smart contracts. It allows developers to change NFT ownership, implement transfer logic, and ensure data integrity. When used effectively, `nft-transfer?` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to handle NFT transfer operations.
