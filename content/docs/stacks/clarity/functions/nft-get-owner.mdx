description: Retrieving the owner of a non-fungible token (NFT) in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(nft-get-owner? asset-class asset-identifier)
```

- Input: `AssetName, A`
- Output: `(optional principal)`

## Why it matters

The `nft-get-owner?` function is crucial for:

1. Retrieving the owner of a non-fungible token (NFT).
2. Implementing logic that depends on the ownership of NFTs.
3. Ensuring data integrity by verifying ownership records.
4. Simplifying the process of accessing ownership information in smart contracts.

## When to use it

Use `nft-get-owner?` when you need to:

- Retrieve the owner of an NFT.
- Implement logic that depends on the ownership of NFTs.
- Verify ownership records in your smart contract.
- Access ownership information for NFTs.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the `asset-identifier` is correctly formatted and exists.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other NFT functions for comprehensive NFT management.
- Handle the `none` case to avoid runtime errors.

## Practical Example: Retrieving NFT Owner

Let's implement a function that retrieves the owner of an NFT:

```clarity
(define-non-fungible-token stackaroo (string-ascii 40))

(define-read-only (get-nft-owner (id (string-ascii 40)))
  (nft-get-owner? stackaroo id)
)

;; Usage
(nft-mint? stackaroo "Roo" tx-sender) ;; Returns (ok true)
(get-nft-owner "Roo") ;; Returns (some tx-sender)
(get-nft-owner "NonExistent") ;; Returns none
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `nft-get-owner?` to retrieve the owner of an NFT.
2. Implementing a read-only function to return the owner's principal.
3. Handling both the case where the NFT exists and where it does not.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `nft-get-owner?` with an incorrect or non-existent `asset-identifier`, causing the function to return `none`.
2. Assuming the NFT will always exist, leading to unhandled `none` cases.
3. Not handling all possible conditions, resulting in incomplete ownership checks.
4. Overlooking the need for proper error handling and validation.

## Related Functions

- `nft-mint?`: Mints a new non-fungible token.
- `nft-transfer?`: Transfers ownership of a non-fungible token.
- `nft-burn?`: Burns a non-fungible token.

## Conclusion

The `nft-get-owner?` function is a fundamental tool for retrieving the owner of non-fungible tokens in Clarity smart contracts. It allows developers to access ownership information, verify ownership records, and implement logic based on NFT ownership. When used effectively, `nft-get-owner?` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to manage NFT ownership.
