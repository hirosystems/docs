description: Converting integers to UTF-8 string representations in Clarity smart contracts.

## Function Signature

```clarity
(int-to-utf8 value)
```




- Input: `int | uint`
- Output: `(string-utf8 40)`

## Why it matters

The `int-to-utf8` function is crucial for:

1. Converting integer values to their UTF-8 string representations.
2. Facilitating the display and logging of numeric data in a more versatile encoding.
3. Enabling the use of numeric values in contexts that require UTF-8 strings.
4. Simplifying the process of creating human-readable outputs from numeric data.

## When to use it

Use `int-to-utf8` when you need to:

- Convert an integer or unsigned integer to a UTF-8 string.
- Display numeric values in a human-readable format.
- Log or store numeric data as UTF-8 strings.
- Prepare numeric data for concatenation with other UTF-8 strings.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the integer value is within the range that can be represented as a string.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other string functions for more complex string manipulations.
- Be aware of the maximum length of the resulting string (40 characters).

## Practical Example: Logging a User's Balance

Let's implement a function that logs a user's balance as a UTF-8 string:

```clarity
(define-map userBalances { userId: principal } { balance: uint })

(define-public (log-balance (user principal))
  (let
    (
      (balance (default-to u0 (map-get? userBalances { userId: user })))
      (balanceStr (int-to-utf8 balance))
    )
    (print balanceStr)
  )
)

;; Usage
(map-set userBalances { userId: tx-sender } { balance: u100 })
(log-balance tx-sender) ;; Logs "100"
```




This example demonstrates:
1. Using `int-to-utf8` to convert a user's balance to a UTF-8 string.
2. Logging the string representation of the balance using `print`.
3. Handling the case where the user has no balance set.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming the resulting string will always fit within 40 characters.
2. Forgetting to handle cases where the integer value is not set or is zero.
3. Using `int-to-utf8` in performance-critical sections without considering the overhead.
4. Not combining with other string functions for more complex manipulations.

## Related Functions

- `print`: Used to log or display string values.
- `concat`: Used to concatenate multiple strings.
- `default-to`: Used to provide default values for optional types.

## Conclusion

The `int-to-utf8` function is a powerful tool for converting integer values to their UTF-8 string representations in Clarity smart contracts. It enables developers to create human-readable outputs from numeric data, facilitating logging, display, and storage of numeric values as strings. When used effectively, `int-to-utf8` enhances the readability and usability of numeric data within your smart contract code.
