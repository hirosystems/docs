Clarinet supports different network types to cater to various development and testing needs:

| Network          | Description                                                                      | Use case
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `simnet`       | Optimized for fast feedback loops, introspection, and portability. | Ideal for initial development and unit-testing. |
| `devnet`       | Local Stacks and Bitcoin nodes running on Docker for faster feedback loops. | Use for integration tests or local frontend development. |
| `testnet`      | A pre-production network that offers a realistic environment for testing. | Ideal for final testing before deploying to Mainnet. |
| `mainnet`      | The production network where real transactions occur. | Use when you're ready to deploy your smart contract to production. |
