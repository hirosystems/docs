Deployment plans minimize the inherent complexity of deployments, such as smart contract dependencies and interactions, transaction chaining limits, deployment costs, and more. Deployment plans ensure reproducible deployments, a critical workflow for testing purposes.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. Generate and configure a deployment plan.
2. Set deployment plan specifications.
3. Add project contract requirements.
4. Customize your deployment plan.

---

### Prerequisites

To follow this quickstart guide, you will need to have Clarinet installed on your machine. For installation options, go [here](/stacks/clarinet/installation).

---

### View your deployment plan

Clarinet uses a deployment plan for every deployment—whether for a basic simnet (for use in Clarinet's `console`, `test`, and `check` features), a devnet (for use with the `clarinet devnet start` command), or the public `testnet` and `mainnet`.

You can view the current deployment plan saved to disk at any time with the following command (specifying the network `simnet`, `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`)

```bash title="Terminal"
clarinet deployments generate --<network>
```

Upon this command, your project's default deployment plan, a `.yaml` file (for example, `default.devnet-plan.yaml`), is generated from your project specifications and contracts. Here, for example, is the deployment plan for [the counter smart contract](/stacks/clarinet/quickstart) used in our quickstart guide:

```yaml title="deployments/default.devnet-plan.yaml"
---
id: 0
name: Devnet deployment
network: devnet
stacks-node: "http://localhost:20443"
bitcoin-node: "http://devnet:devnet@localhost:18443"
plan:
  batches:
    - id: 0
      transactions:
        - contract-publish:
            contract-name: counter
            expected-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
            cost: 6940
            path: contracts/counter.clar
            anchor-block-only: true
            clarity-version: 2
      epoch: "2.5"
```

### Deployment plan specifications

A project's deployment plan specifications are set on two files within a Clarinet project—the `Clarinet.toml` file as well as the network’s corresponding `.toml` file (for example, `Devnet.toml`) in the `settings/` folder.

Specifications in the `Clarinet.toml` file you can change include:

- The Clarity version or blockchain epoch that Clarinet emulates for your smart contracts
- Project requirements in the form of contract dependencies (see next section)

Specifications in the `Devnet.toml` file you can change include:

- Accounts, balances, and names
- Blockchain environment features of your devnet, such as block time or API ports
- Stacking orders

### Adding project contract requirements

Your project can reference a smart contract that already exists on the blockchain.

For example, [Stacks Improvement Proposal 009](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-010/sip-010-fungible-token-standard.md) specifies a trait reference for all non-fungible tokens. Instead of redeploying this trait as a separate contract each time a new NFT collection is published, you can reference the contract directly within deployment plans with the following Clarinet command, including the contract principal reference:

```bash title="Terminal"
clarinet requirements add SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.nft-trait
```

This command updates a Clarinet project's deployment plan for use in development.

For instance, `clarinet devnet start` would now download a copy of the contract principal via the Stacks API node that is booted alongside each devnet deployment, and it would remap the principal that publishes this contract to one of the accounts specified in your `Devnet.toml` file.

This permits a developer to maintain the minimum set of contracts their Clarinet project will deploy to mainnet (with a single use of an `impl-trait` statement in their Clarity contract).

### Edit your deployment plan

Recall that a default deployment plan is used for every deployment, comprising your projects specifications as set in your `Clarinet.toml` and `<network>.toml` files.

The default plan is generated upon each `clarinet deployments generate --<network>` shell command to your `deployments/` folder.

However, you can also manually edit this default deployment `.yaml` file directly—programmatically orchestrating your contract publication and user interaction beyond your plan's defaults.

<Callout>
When deploying, Clarinet prompts you to overwrite any manually added or edited changes that differ from the specifications laid out in your project's .toml files. Type `no` to proceed with your manually configured deployment plan instead of the default.
</Callout>

Here are some of the relevant transactions and configurations available to developers manually configuring their deployment plans:

- `emulated-contract-publish:` Deploy a contract in an in-memory simulated chain (`simnet` only).
- `emulated-contract-call:` Call a contract that has been deployed in an in-memory simulated chain (`simnet` only).
- `requirement-publish:` Deploy an external contract (that is, one not published by the same set of private keys as the user wallet currently deploying) on another testnet/devnet using another wallet + search, and replace all the references to this contract in the local contracts to deploy (`devnet`/`testnet` only).
- `contract-publish:` Deploy a contract (`devnet`/`testnet`/`mainnet`).
- `contract-call:` Call a contract (`devnet`/`testnet`/`mainnet`).
- `stx-transfer:` Transfer STX between specified accounts.
- `btc-transfer:` Simple bitcoin transfer from a p2pkh address to a p2pkh address (experimental, `regtest`/`testnet`/`mainnet`).

Waiting between blocks to make transactions is done by specifying transaction directives in a different batch in the deployment plan (see the `batches` field).

### <code className='text-lg'>emulated-contract-publish</code>

This default transaction is included in every generated deployment for a `simnet` deployment.

```yaml
- emulated-contract-publish:
    contract-name: extension-trait
    emulated-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
    path: contracts/dao/traits/extension-trait.clar
    clarity-version: 1
```

### <code className='text-lg'>emulated-contract-call</code>

This is a transaction type for a `simnet` deployment where the developer wants to emulate a contract call.

```yaml
- emulated-contract-call:
    contract-id: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.counter
    emulated-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
    method: increment
    parameters:
      - u1
```

<Callout>
Read-only functions and functions that take no arguments are passed an empty list like so: `parameters: []`
</Callout>

### <code className='text-lg'>requirement-publish</code>

This cBTC smart contract application has a [devnet deployment plan](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/blob/develop/components/clarinet-cli/examples/cbtc/deployments/default.devnet-plan.yaml) that publishes the contract required by its core smart contract.
