## About sBTC

sBTC is a fungible token on the Stacks blockchain. It follows the
[SIP-010 standard](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-010/sip-010-fungible-token-standard.md)
for fungible tokens.

Even though it's *just* a fungible token. Clarinet has some helpers to make it easier to work with.

## Using sBTC in your contract

To use sBTC in your contract, you need to add the `sbtc-deposit` smart contract to your requirements.

In a Clarinet project, run the following command:

```terminal
$ clarinet requirements add SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-deposit
```

This will add the [`sbtc-deposit`](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-deposit)
smart contract to your project, along with it's dependencies:
- [`sbtc-token`](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token)
- [`sbtc-registry`](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-registry)

When Clarinet detects the `sbtc-deposit` contract, it will automatically fund the test wallets with 
sBTC that you can use to test your contract in the Simnet and Devnet.

## Using sBTC in your contract

As a SIP-010 token, sBTC let you call the `transfer` function to transfer tokens from one address to another.  
Let's say we have an NFT contract that allows users to mint an NFT by spending sBTC.  


```clarity
;; this code is for demo purposes
;; it doesn't implement SIP-009 NFT standard
(define-non-fungible-token nft-name uint)

;; mint for 100 sats
(define-data-var sats-sbtc-mint-price uint u100)
(define-data-var next-id uint u0)

(define-public (mint-one-with-sbtc)
  (begin
    ;; call the sbtc-token contract to transfer the sbtcs
    (try! (contract-call? 'SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4.sbtc-token transfer
      (var-get sats-sbtc-mint-price)
      tx-sender
      (as-contract tx-sender)
      none
    ))

    (try! (nft-mint? nft-name (var-get next-id) tx-sender))

    (ok (var-set next-id (+ (var-get next-id) u1)))
  )
)
```

Because Clarinet already took care of funding the test wallets with sBTC, you can call the
`mint-one-with-sbtc` function with one of the test wallets.

In the Simnet (unit tests or `clarinet console`), the deployer address of the contract will remain
`SM3VDXK3WZZSA84XXFKAFAF15NNZX32CTSG82JFQ4`, but in Devnet, like every otehr requirements, it will
be deployed by the default deployer address. You don't have to care about it, Clarinet always make
sure that your contracts call the right address.

## Deploying your contract on Testnet

On testnet, the official Hiro sBTC contract is
[ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-token](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-token?chain=testnet).
This is the contract that is linked to the sBTC faucet: `ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-deposit`.

Again, Clarinet will make sure that your contracts call this address when being deployed on mainnet.
You can see the of the sbtc-contract being re-mapped in the testnet deployment plan.

## Deploying your contract on Mainnet

On mainnet, your contract will remain unchanged and call the one and only sBTC contract.
