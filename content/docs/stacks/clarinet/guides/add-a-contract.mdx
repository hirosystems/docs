title: Add a contract
description: Clarinet can handle adding and configuring a new contract to your project.

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';
import { Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

To add a new contract, run the `clarinet contract new` command inside your project along with your contract name.

 ```bash title="Terminal"
clarinet contract new my-contract
```

**Clarinet** will add 2 files to your project: `my-contract.clar` and `my-contract.test.ts`.

<Files className='pointer-events-none'>
  <Folder name="contracts" defaultOpen>
    <File name="my-contract.clar" className='bg-muted' />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="settings" />
  <Folder name="tests" defaultOpen>
    <File name="my-contract.test.ts" className='bg-muted' />
  </Folder>
  <File name=".gitignore" />
  <File name="Clarinet.toml" />
  <File name="package.json" />
  <File name="tsconfig.json" />
  <File name="vitest.config.js" />
</Files>

**Clarinet** will also add the configuration to the `Clarinet.toml` file for your contract.

```toml
[contracts.my-contract]
path = 'contracts/my-contract.clar'
clarity_version = 2
epoch = 2.4
```

<Callout title="Adding contracts manually" type="warn">
You may add contracts to your project by adding the files manually; however, you must add the appropriate configuration to `Clarinet.toml` in order for **Clarinet** to recognize the contracts.
