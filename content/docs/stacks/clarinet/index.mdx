} from "@/components/ui/tooltip"

Using a simple command line interface, Clarinet enables you to build and iterate on your contracts locally before moving into production on the `mainnet` network.

You can code with <TooltipProvider inline><Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className='cursor-default border-b border-dotted border-primary'>Clarity syntax support</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>Using the [Clarity VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HiroSystems.clarity-lsp#:~:text=This%20VS%20Code%20extension%20brings,safety%20checks%2C%20debugger%20and%20more)</TooltipContent></Tooltip></TooltipProvider>, run tests, debug your code line by line, and deploy your contracts to a local Stacks blockchain environment to rapidly iterate on your code. It can also be used locally or as a hosted service in the cloud via the [Hiro Platform](/stacks/platform).

To get started, check out our [Installation Guide](/stacks/clarinet/installation).

### Network types

Clarinet supports different network types to cater to various development and testing needs:

| Network          | Description                                                                      | Use case
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `simnet`       | Optimized for fast feedback loops, introspection, and portability. | Ideal for initial development and unit-testing. |
| `devnet`       | Local Stacks and Bitcoin nodes running on Docker for faster feedback loops. | Use for integration tests or local frontend development. |
| `testnet`      | A pre-production network that offers a realistic environment for testing. | Ideal for final testing before deploying to Mainnet. |
| `mainnet`      | The production network where real transactions occur. | Use when you're ready to deploy your smart contract to production. |

### Related Tools
