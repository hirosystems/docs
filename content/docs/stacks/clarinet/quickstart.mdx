In this quickstart guide, you will write a simple counter contract with Clarity. Throughout this tutorial, you'll learn how to generate a new project, create a smart contract, and validate your smart contract code using the Clarinet CLI.

Check out the [create a new project](/stacks/clarinet/guides/create-a-new-project) and [validate a contract](/stacks/clarinet/guides/validate-a-contract) guides for a deeper look.

    ## Generate your counter project
  
    Start by creating a new Clarinet project. This command will create a new directory named _console`counter`_ and set up a basic Clarinet project inside it.

    ```terminal
    $ clarinet new counter

    ## Create a counter contract
  
    Inside your project directory, run _console`clarinet contract new counter`_ to create your contract. This will generate and update the proper files for writing and testing your code.

    ```terminal
    $ cd counter
    $ clarinet contract new counter
    [32mCreated file[0m [1mcontracts/counter.clar[0m
    [32mCreated file[0m [1mtests/counter.test.ts[0m
    [33mUpdated Clarinet.toml[0m [1mwith contract counter[0m
    ```

    ```toml Clarinet.toml
    [contracts.counter]
    path = 'contracts/counter.clar'
    clarity_version = 2
    epoch = 2.5
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Variables and functions
  
    Inside your _txt`contracts/counter.clar`_ file:

    1. Define a map called _clarity`Counters`_ to store the count associated with each user.
    2. Define a public function called _clarity`count-up`_ that increments the count of the user who calls it.
    3. Add a read-only function called _clarity`get-count`_ that returns the count of the user who calls it.

    ```clarity counter.clar -c
    (define-map Counters principal uint)

    (define-public (count-up)
      (ok (map-set Counters tx-sender (+ (get-count tx-sender) u1)))
    )

    (define-read-only (get-count (who principal))
      (default-to u0 (map-get? Counters who))
    )
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Validate your contract
  
    Now it's time to validate your contract. This command will check your contract for errors and typos.

    ```terminal
    $ clarinet check
    [32m✔[0m [1m1 contract checked[0m
    ```

    Once your contract is validated, you can interact with it locally with the _console`clarinet console`_ inside your project directory.

    ```terminal
    $ clarinet console
    ```

    Here are some example interactions you can perform with your contract:

    1. Call the _clarity`count-up`_ function on your contract to increment the count.
    2. Verify the count of the user has been incremented by calling the _clarity`get-count`_ function with the _clarity`tx-sender`_ as the argument.
    
    ```terminal
    $ (contract-call? .counter count-up)
    [32m(ok true)[0m
    $ (contract-call? .counter get-count tx-sender)
    [32mu1[0m
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
