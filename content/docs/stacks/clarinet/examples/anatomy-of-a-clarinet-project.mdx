title: Anatomy of a Clarinet Project
description: Learn about how a Clarinet project is structured.
---

This document provides a detailed overview of the files that need to be present in a Clarinet
project. And how to configure the differents tools being used. Including Clarinet but also other
tools like Vitest, TypeScript, etc.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── Clarinet.toml
├── contracts
│   └── my-contract.clar
├── package.json
├── settings
│   ├── Devnet.toml
│   ├── Mainnet.toml
│   └── Testnet.toml
├── tests
│   └── my-contract.test.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vitest.config.js
```

## Clarinet.toml

This is the manifest of the project. It contains the name of the project as well as a few other
properties.

This is also this file that will list the smart contracts that are part of the project, including
their name and the path to the file. We recommend to always set the `clarity_version` and `epoch` to
the latest. Especially the `epoch`, since you smart contract will eventually be deployed in this
epoch on mainnet.

```toml
[contracts.my-contract]
path = 'contracts/my-contract.clar'
clarity_version = 3
epoch = 3.1
```

## package.json

Because Clarinet relies on Node.js and NPM to write unit tests for your project, there is a
package.json file that will list the dependencies of the project. By defualt, Clarinet comes with
the following dependencies:

- `@hirosystems/clarinet-sdk`: The Clarinet JS SDK is a version of the Clarinet that is compiled to
  Wasm that can run in Node.js. It's used to interact with the Simnet.
- `vitest`: This the testing framework that Clarinet uses to run the tests. Learn more on the
  [Vitest website](https://vitest.dev/).
- `@stacks/transactions`: This is the Stacks transactions library that is used to interact with
  Clarity values in JavaScript
- `chokidar-cli`: This is a library that is used to watch the files and re-run tests on changes.
- `vitest-environment-clarinet`: this library help bootstrapping the Simnet in the testing
  environment. For example, it will initialize the Simnet and makes sure it available globally in
  the testing environment.

As of May 2025, Clarinet 3.0 support the latest version of these dependencies, especially:

- `vitest` 3.x
- `@stacks/transactions` 7.x

We recommend to always use the latest version of `@hirosystems/clarinet-sdk` and
`vitest-environment-clarinet`.

## vitest.config.js

This is the configuration file for Vitest. Here, we specify some inmportant settings for the testing
framework to work with Clarinet. This is what the default configuration looks like:

```js
/// <reference types="vitest" />

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { vitestSetupFilePath, getClarinetVitestsArgv } from "@hirosystems/clarinet-sdk/vitest";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: "clarinet", // use vitest-environment-clarinet
    pool: "forks",
    poolOptions: {
      forks: { singleFork: true },
    },
    setupFiles: [
      vitestSetupFilePath,
      // custom setup files can be added here
    ],
    environmentOptions: {
      clarinet: {
        ...getClarinetVitestsArgv(),
        // add or override options
      },
    },
  },
});
```

It export a configuration object with `export default defineConfig({ test: {}})` where we specify
the following options:

- `environment: "clarinet"`: Tell vitest to use the `vitest-environment-clarinet` environment.
- `pool: "forks"`, now the default value in Vitest 3.x. Tells Vitest to run process in
  `child_process`, learn more in [Vitest docs](https://vitest.dev/config/#pool).
- `poolOptions: { forks: { singleFork: true } }`, run all tests in the same process. Thus allowing
  efficient re-use of the Simnet and caching. Test isolation is provided by resetting the Simnet for
  each test. The `setupFiles` are taking care of it.

## tsconfig.json

This is a regular TypeScript configuration file. The `compilerOptions` are customizable to suit your
needs and preferences.

It's impotant to properly set the `include` property, by default it points to the helpers files
defined the clarinet-sdk package, and to the tests directory. In a monorepo setup with multiple
package, you might need to adjust the path to node_modules.

```json
  "include": [
    "node_modules/@hirosystems/clarinet-sdk/vitest-helpers/src",
    "tests"
  ]
```
