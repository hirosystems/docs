import { Clarinet, Js } from '@/components/ui/icon';
import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

Inside the console, you can use these debugging commands:

```terminal
$ ::trace (contract-call? .my-contract my-function)
$ ::debug (contract-call? .my-contract my-function)
$ break my-function
```

Debug navigation commands:
- _console`step`_ or _console`s`_ - Step into
- _console`finish`_ or _console`f`_ - Step out
- _console`next`_ or _console`n`_ - Step over
- _console`continue`_ or _console`c`_ - Continue execution

Let's take the clarity_`counter`_ contract as an example:

```clarity
(define-map Counters principal uint)

(define-read-only (get-count (who principal))
  (default-to u0 (map-get? Counters who))
)

(define-public (count-up)
  (ok (map-set Counters tx-sender (+ (get-count tx-sender) u1)))
)
```

### Trace

The _console`::trace`_ command expects an expression, so make a _clarity`contract-call?`_ with our _clarity`count-up`_ function and see what happens.

```terminal
$ ::trace (contract-call? .counter count-up)
(contract-call? .counter count-up)  [30m<console>[0m
( get-count tx-sender )  [30mcounter:4:38[0m
  [31mâ†³ args:[0m [1mST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM[0m
    [34mu0[0m
[34m(ok true)[0m
```

### Breakpoints

You can also set a breakpoint at a specific line to better understand what's happening in your contract.

With `::debug`, you can add breakpoints at a specific line of a contract or function to better understand what's happening in your contracts.

```clarity
(define-map Counters principal uint)

(define-read-only (get-count (who principal))
  (default-to u0 (map-get? Counters who))
)

(define-public (count-up)
  (ok (map-set Counters tx-sender (+ (get-count tx-sender) u1)))
)

;; !mark(1:3)
(define-public (count-twice)
  (double)
)

;; !mark(1:6)
(define-private (double)
  (begin
    (unwrap-panic (count-up))
    (count-up)
  )
)
```

```terminal
$ ::debug (contract-call? .counter count-twice)
$ break count-up
```


<Callout title="Breakpoint Commands">
To step through these breakpoints, you can use one of the following commands:

- **Step-in (`step` or `s`)**: Step into the sub-expressions.
- **Step-out (`finish` or `f`)**: Complete execution of the current expression and return the result to the parent.
- **Step-over (`next` or `n`)**: Continue to completion of the current expression, stepping over sub-expressions.
- **Continue (`continue` or `c`)**: Continue execution until hitting a breakpoint or completing execution.
</Callout>

Using the _console`continue`_ command, the breakpoint you set in the _clarity`double`_ function will trigger twice due to two _clarity`count-up`_ calls, which enables you to do variable and map analysis.
