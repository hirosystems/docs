Hiro Hacks are monthly hackathons designed to bring together the most innovative builders in the Stacks ecosystem. Each month features a unique theme, challenging you to stretch your creativity, show off your skills, and learn from other devs in the process.

Have fun. Build something new. Compete against other devs for a scholarship to Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas (scroll down for details).

To submit your projects each month, [complete this form](https://hirohacks25.paperform.co/) before midnight ET on the last day of that month's hack.

## Prizes

For March's hack, we will be awarding 2 developer scholarships to 2 different winners. Each developer scholarship includes **hotel accommodations**, a **$1,000 travel stipend**, and **tickets to [Bitcoin 2025](https://b.tc/conference/2025)** in Las Vegas.

Code your way to Vegas and spend time with Stacks builders while diving into the zany world of the biggest Bitcoin conference of the year.

## Resources

Need help hacking on your project? [Join the Stacks Discord](https://stacks.chat) and get help from other devs in the #builder-general channel. If you're having problems using Hiro tools, you can also reach out to our team in the relevant tool channel in the Hiro Developer Tools section.

And don't forget to take advantage of all of the resources in our docs as well as [Stacks docs](https://docs.stacks.co/).

## Rules

To be eligible for swag and the hacker house, you must submit your project through [this paperform](https://hirohacks25.paperform.co/) before midnight ET on the last day of that month's hack.

In that submission, we expect to see:

- A link to your project (if applicable)
- A link to your code with a clear README (or link to a PR if submitting a recipe)
- A description that covers the problem being solved, the technical approach, and future improvements for the project

In terms of selecting winners, submissions will be evaluated on their technical implementation, their innovation/creativity, and their documentation/presentation. To learn more about the rules, read [Hiro Hacks Terms & Conditions](https://www.hiro.so/hiro-hacks-rules).
