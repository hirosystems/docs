## March: Create an app that interacts with sBTC

*Build an app or feature that interacts with sBTC. Compete for your scholarship.*

**Timeline**: March 26 - April 1, 2025

This month's challenge is to build with [sBTC](https://www.stacks.co/sbtc), the new programmable Bitcoin-backed asset on Stacks. Since its launch in December, sBTC has brought $260M of BTC liquidity directly to Stacks. With sBTC withdrawals going live on March 31st, there's never been a better time to start building with sBTC, and this is your perfect opportunity to get started.

We will be awarding 2 developer scholarships to 2 different winners this month. Each scholarship will receive **hotel accommodations**, a **$1,000 travel stipend**, and tickets to **Bitcoin 2025** in Las Vegas.

Submit your project [here](https://hirohacks25.paperform.co/).

Your submission can be a full-fledged application, or a new feature in your existing project. The one requirement is it has to interact with sBTC in some way.

## Some example recipe ideas to explore

- A cli command for transferring sBTC
- An analytics dashboard for sBTC activity
- Any kind of smart contract functionality that interacts with sBTC
