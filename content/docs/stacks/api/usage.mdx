### Base URL

The Stacks API is built on REST principles, enforcing HTTPS for all requests to ensure data security, integrity, and privacy. The base URL for all API requests is:

```plaintext
https://api.mainnet.hiro.so
```

### Making requests

To make a request to the Stacks API, you can paste the `curl` command below in your terminal.

```bash title="Terminal"
curl -L 'https://api.hiro.so/v2/info' \
-H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Authentication

If you are using an `api-key`, you will need to replace `$HIRO_API_KEY` with your secret API key.

```bash title="Terminal"
curl -L 'https://api.hiro.so/v2/info' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-Key: $HIRO_API_KEY' # [!code highlight]
```

### Response codes

The Stacks API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

- **`200`**: Successful request
- **`400`**: Check that the parameters were correct
- **`401`**: Missing API key
- **`403`**: Invalid API key
- **`404`**: Resource not found
- **`429`**: Rate limit exceeded
- **`5xx`**: Server errors

### Rate limits

| API key | Rate limit                        |
|:--------|:----------------------------------|
| No      | 100 requests per minute (RPM) per client IP, for unauthenticated traffic |
| Yes     | 500 requests per minute (RPM) regardless of origin IP, with an authenticated API key |
