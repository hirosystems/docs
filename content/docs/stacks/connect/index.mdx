Stacks Connect is a JavaScript library that can authenticate the identity of your users and prompt them to sign transactions and messages. In other words, Stacks Connect handles some of the most basic functions you need in a web app, including enabling users to log in to your app as well as broadcasting in-app transactions to the Stacks network.

Stacks Connect is one of the most popular packages of [Stacks.js](/stacks/stacks.js). To get started with Stacks Connect, view the [installation guide](/stacks/connect/installation).
