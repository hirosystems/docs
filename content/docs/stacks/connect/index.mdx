Stacks.js is a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for building on the Stacks blockchain. It's a collection of various JavaScript libraries that allow you to broadcast a transaction with the Stacks blockchain, authenticate users, sign messages, and more. Some of the most important building blocks, all in one place.

Stacks.js is separated into many smaller packages, which can be installed individually. Most packages are published to npm under the `@stacks` scope.

For more details, check out out our [installation guide](./stacks.js/installation).
