In this quickstart guide, you will initialize a simulated development network for testing a smart contract using the Clarinet JS SDK. You'll learn how to initialize your project, interact with a smart contract, call its functions, and test the results.

Check out the [methods](/stacks/clarinet-js-sdk/references/methods) page for the Clarinet JS SDK to learn about the different ways that you can interact with simnet.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Importing dependencies
  
    Before we dive in, navigate to your project and import the `Cl` helper from the `@stacks/transactions` package in your test file.

    <Files className='pointer-events-none'>
      <Folder name="contracts" defaultOpen>
        <File name="counter.clar" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="settings" />
      <Folder name="tests" defaultOpen>
        <File name="counter.test.ts" className='bg-[hsl(var(--highlight))]' />
      </Folder>
      <File name=".gitignore" />
      <File name="Clarinet.toml" />
      <File name="package.json" />
      <File name="tsconfig.json" />
      <File name="vitest.config.js" />
    </Files>

    ```ts title="counter.test.ts"
    import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
    import { Cl } from "@stacks/transactions"; // [!code highlight]
    ```

    The `Cl` namespace simplifies the process of creating and handling Clarity values. This functionality is particularly useful in testing environments where developers need to simulate contract interactions accurately.
   
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Retrieve an account from the simnet
  
    For most test cases, you'll want to retrieve an account from the network in order to interact with your smart contracts. The following code uses the `getAccounts` method to achieve this.

    ```ts title="counter.test.ts"
    // [!code word:getAccounts]
    import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
    import { Cl } from "@stacks/transactions";

    const accounts = simnet.getAccounts();
    const wallet = accounts.get("wallet_1")!;
    ```

    <Callout title="Note">
      The `--stacks` flag is required and allows you to specify the network to scan. Other options include `--bitcoin`.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Write your first test
  
    The process for writing tests for smart contracts with the Clarinet JS SDK follows a structured approach similar to testing in JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

    1. Define the group of tests you want to run using the `describe` block.
    2. Define the test you want to run using the `it` block.
    3. Call the function and assert the result using the `expect` function.

    Now that you understand the key components for writing tests, start by writing a test that ensures the `counter` contract has been deployed.

    ```ts title="counter.test.ts"
    describe("counter contract", () => {
      it("ensures the contract is deployed", () => {
        const contractSource = simnet.getContractSource("counter"); // [!code highlight]
        expect(contractSource).toBeDefined();
      });
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Test the count-up function
  
    Now it's time to call a public function and assert the result. The <code>count-up</code> function is expected to increment the count of the user's principal by 1. Write a test to ensure this behaves as expected.

    ```ts title="counter.test.ts"
    describe("counter contract", () => {
      it("increments the count of the user's principal by 1", () => {
        const countUpCall = simnet.callPublicFn("counter", "count-up", [], wallet);
        expect(countUpCall.result).toBeOk(Cl.bool(true)); // [!code highlight]
        
        const getCountCall = simnet.callReadOnlyFn(
          "counter",
          "get-count",
          [Cl.principal(wallet)],
          wallet
        );
        expect(getCountCall.result).toBeUint(1); // [!code highlight]
      });
    });
    ```

    Above, the `count-up` function is called, and the result is asserted to return an `(ok true)`. Then, the count for the user's principal is retrieved and asserted to be `u1`.

    <Callout title="Custom matchers">
      <p>The <code>toBeOk</code> and <code>toBeUint</code> methods are used to ensure the `count-up` function returns the proper Clarity values. For more details, check out the [custom matchers](/stacks/clarinet-js-sdk/references/custom-matchers) page.</p>
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Run your tests

    Every generated project comes with a <code>package.json</code> file that contains the necessary dependencies and scripts to run your tests.
  
    ```json title="package.json"
    "scripts": {
      "test": "vitest run", // [!code highlight]
      "test:report": "vitest run -- --coverage --costs",
      "test:watch": "chokidar \"tests/**/*.ts\" \"contracts/**/*.clar\" -c \"npm run test:report\""
    }
    ```

    You can now run your tests, with your preferred package manager, by executing the following command:
  
    ```console
    npm run test
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Run your tests with code coverage and cost analysis

    Clarinet can automatically also produce a code coverage report and cost analysis on the test you ran.

    ```json title="package.json"
    "scripts": {
      "test": "vitest run",
      "test:report": "vitest run -- --coverage --costs", // [!code highlight]
      "test:watch": "chokidar \"tests/**/*.ts\" \"contracts/**/*.clar\" -c \"npm run test:report\""
    }
    ```

    By running the `npm run test:report` command in your terminal, an `lcov.info` and `costs-reports.json` file will appear in your root folder:

    <Files className='pointer-events-none'>
      <Folder name="contracts" defaultOpen>
        <File name="counter.clar" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="settings" />
      <Folder name="tests" defaultOpen>
        <File name="counter.test.ts" />
      </Folder>
      <File name=".gitignore" />
      <File name="Clarinet.toml" />
      <File name="costs-reports.json" className='bg-[hsl(var(--highlight))]' />
      <File name="lcov.info" className='bg-[hsl(var(--highlight))]' />
      <File name="package.json" />
      <File name="tsconfig.json" />
      <File name="vitest.config.js" />
    </Files>

    The `costs-reports.json` file will output the cost analysis for every function ran in your tests. Since the `count-up` function was used in our test, this is how the cost analysis output would look like for that function:

    ```json title="costs-reports.json"
      {
        "test_name": "tests/counter.test.ts__counter contract__increments the count of the user's principal by 1",
        "contract_id": "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.counter",
        "method": "count-up",
        "args": [],
        "cost_result": {
          "total": {
            "write_length": 41,
            "write_count": 1,
            "read_length": 245,
            "read_count": 5,
            "runtime": 4752
          },
          "limit": {
            "write_length": 15000000,
            "write_count": 15000,
            "read_length": 100000000,
            "read_count": 15000,
            "runtime": 5000000000
          },
          "memory": 40,
          "memory_limit": 100000000
        }
      }
    ```

    To access and read the `lcov.info` file in a human-readable format, we can first install the `lcov` [package](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) that helps generate a graphical front-end for coverage testing tools.

    ```console title="Terminal"
    brew install lcov
    ```

    Then we'll run the `genhtml` command below with the following options. This command and its options will generate the actual html file, add in additional branch coverage, and will automatically store the files in a new folder called `coverage`.

    ```console title="Terminal"
    genhtml lcov.info --branch-coverage -o coverage
    ```

    You can then navigate into the new `coverage` folder and run the command `open index.html` to view your coverage report. In addition, a summary of the coverage report will be outputted in the terminal.
