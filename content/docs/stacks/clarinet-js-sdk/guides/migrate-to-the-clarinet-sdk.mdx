In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. Migrate your existing Clarinet projects to the Clarinet SDK.
2. Run your existing tests using the Clarinet SDK.

<Callout>
This guide is for projects that have been created with Clarinet v1 and do not have the v2 boilerplate code auto-generated in their projects.
</Callout>

---

### Prerequisites

The SDK requires Node.js >= 18.0 and NPM to be installed. [Volta](https://volta.sh/) is a great tool to install and manage JS tooling.

---

### Executing the migration script

Inside your Clarinet v1 project, run the following command to initialise NPM and Vitest. It will also create a sample test file.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @hirosystems/clarinet-sdk@latest
```

Follow the prompts to initialise NPM and Vitest, this can take a few seconds.

<Callout>
The file `tests/counter_test.ts` that was created by `clarinet contract new counter` can be deleted.

You can also have a look at `tests/contract.test.ts`. It's a sample file showing how to use the SDK with Vitest.
It can safely be deleted.
</Callout>

### Unit test for <code className='text-lg'>counter</code> example

```ts title="tests/counter.test.ts"
import { Cl } from '@stacks/transactions';
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';

const accounts = simnet.getAccounts();
const address1 = accounts.get('wallet_1')!;

describe('test `increment` public function', () => {
  it('increments the count by the given value', () => {
    const incrementResponse = simnet.callPublicFn('counter', 'increment', [Cl.uint(1)], address1);
    console.log(Cl.prettyPrint(incrementResponse.result)); // (ok u2)
    expect(incrementResponse.result).toBeOk(Cl.uint(2));

    const count1 = simnet.getDataVar('counter', 'count');
    expect(count1).toBeUint(2);

    simnet.callPublicFn('counter', 'increment', [Cl.uint(40)], address1);
    const count2 = simnet.getDataVar('counter', 'count');
    expect(count2).toBeUint(42);
  });

  it('sends a print event', () => {
    const incrementResponse = simnet.callPublicFn('counter', 'increment', [Cl.uint(1)], address1);

    expect(incrementResponse.events).toHaveLength(1);
    const printEvent = incrementResponse.events[0];
    expect(printEvent.event).toBe('print_event');
    expect(printEvent.data.value).toBeTuple({
      object: Cl.stringAscii('count'),
      action: Cl.stringAscii('incremented'),
      value: Cl.uint(2),
    });
  });
});
```

To run the test, go back to your console and run the `test` command using your preferred package manager. It should display a report telling you that tests succeeded.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm test
```

<Callout>
The `simnet` object is available globally in the tests, and is automatically initialized before each test. You can have a look at the `vitest.config.js` file at the root of you project for more details.
</Callout>

Getting back to the tests - the first test checks that the `increment` function returns the new value and saves it to the `count` variable.
The second test checks that an `print_event` is emitted when the `increment` function is called.

<Callout>
You can use `Cl.prettyPrint(value: ClarityValue)` to format any Clarity value into readable Clarity code. It can be useful to debug function results or event values.
