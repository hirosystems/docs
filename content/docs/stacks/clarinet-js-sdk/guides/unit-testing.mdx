description: Learn how to write and run unit tests for your Clarity smart contracts using the Clarinet JS SDK and Vitest.

import { Accordions, Accordion } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

Unit testing is the process of testing individual components or functions of smart contracts to ensure they work as expected. The Clarinet JS SDK provides a testing framework that allows you to write these tests using the Vitest testing framework, helping you catch bugs and errors early in the development process.

In this guide, you will:

1. [Set up a new Clarinet project with a `defi` contract](#set-up-a-new-clarinet-project).
2. [Write a unit test covering the `deposit` function](#test-the-deposit-function).
3. [Run tests and generate coverage reports](#run-tests-and-generate-coverage-reports).

---

## Set up a new Clarinet project

Start by creating a new project with the Clarinet CLI. The command below will create a project structure inside of `defi` with the necessary files and folders, including the Clarinet JS SDK already set up for testing.

```console title="Terminal"
clarinet new stx-defi
cd stx-defi
```

After changing into your project directory, run `npm install` to install the package dependencies for testing.

```console title="Terminal"
npm install
```

Since the smart contract code is out of scope for this guide, we are going to use a pre-existing contract. First, generate a new file using the `clarinet contract new` command in order to set up your project with the necessary configuration and test files.

```console title="Terminal"
clarinet contract new defi
```

Now, inside your `defi.clar` file, copy and paste the following contract code:

```clarity
;; Holds the total amount of deposits in the contract, initialized to 0.
(define-data-var total-deposits uint u0)

;; Maps a user's principal address to their deposited amount.
(define-map deposits { owner: principal } { amount: uint })

;; Public function for users to deposit STX into the contract.
;; Updates their balance and the total deposits in the contract.
(define-public (deposit (amount uint))
  (let
    (
      ;; Fetch the current balance or default to 0 if none exists.
      (current-balance (default-to u0 (get amount (map-get? deposits { owner: tx-sender }))))
    )
    ;; Transfer the STX from sender = "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM" to recipient = "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.defi (ie: contract identifier on the chain!)".
    (try! (stx-transfer? amount tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender)))
    ;; Update the user's deposit amount in the map.
    (map-set deposits { owner: tx-sender } { amount: (+ current-balance amount) })
    ;; Update the total deposits variable.
    (var-set total-deposits (+ (var-get total-deposits) amount))
    ;; Return success.
    (ok true)
  )
)

;; Read-only function to get the total balance by tx-sender
(define-read-only (get-balance-by-sender)
  (ok (map-get? deposits { owner: tx-sender }))
)
```

Run `clarinet check` to ensure that your smart contract is valid and ready for testing.

## Test the deposit function

This `deposit` function allows users to deposit STX into the contract, updating their balance inside a `deposits` map and adding to the total deposits stored in a `total-deposits` variable. The key tests we want to cover are that the deposit is successful and that the user's balance, as well as the contract's total deposits, are updated correctly.

Inside of your `defi.test.ts` file, replace the boilerplate code and add the following:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { Cl } from '@stacks/transactions';

const accounts = simnet.getAccounts();
const wallet1 = accounts.get('wallet_1')!;
```

These imports provide the testing framework and utilities we need. We also get the `wallet_1` account, which will act as our test user.

Next, define the test suite and the specific test case:

```typescript
describe('stx-defi', () => {
  it('allows users to deposit STX', () => {
    // Test code will go here
  });
});
```

This structure comes from our Vitest integration, and it organizes our tests and describes what we're testing. The `describe` block groups multiple test cases together, while the `it` block represents a single test case.

Now, let's simulate a deposit. Inside of the `it` block, define the amount to deposit and call the `deposit` function:

```typescript
const amount = 1000;
const deposit = simnet.callPublicFn('defi', 'deposit', [Cl.uint(amount)], wallet1);
```

This code simulates a deposit by calling the `deposit` function, using the `callPublicFn` method from the Clarinet JS SDK, in our contract with a specified amount, just as a user would in the real world.

After making the deposit, create an assertion to verify that the call itself was successful and returns an `ok` response type with the value `true`:

```typescript
expect(deposit.result).toBeOk(Cl.bool(true));
```

Run `npm run test` to confirm that this test passes.

Let's go over some of the code in this assertion:

- `expect` is a function from Vitest that makes an assertion about the value we expect to get back from the `deposit` function.

But how do we test against Clarity types and values? This is where the `Cl` and `toBeOk` helpers come in.

- `toBeOk` is a custom matcher function built into Vitest that checks if the result of the deposit call is an `Ok` response, which is a Clarity type. This is important because it confirms that the deposit transaction was processed successfully.
- `Cl` helper is from the `@stacks/transactions` package and is used to create Clarity values in JavaScript. In this case, it's used to create a Clarity boolean with the value of `true`.

Once we can confirm that the deposit was successful, write a test to verify that the contract's total deposits have been updated correctly.

```typescript
const totalDeposits = simnet.getDataVar('defi', 'total-deposits');
expect(totalDeposits).toBeUint(amount);
```

Run `npm run test` again to confirm that this test also passes.

This check ensures that the contract accepted our deposit without any issues.

Lastly, verify that the user's balance has been updated correctly:

```typescript
const balance = simnet.callReadOnlyFn('defi', 'get-balance-by-sender', [], wallet1);
expect(balance.result).toBeOk(
  Cl.some(
    Cl.tuple({
      amount: Cl.uint(amount),
    })
  )
);
```

We call the `get-balance-by-sender` function and check if it matches the amount we just deposited.

By following these steps, our test comprehensively verifies that the `deposit` function works as intended, updating individual balances and total deposits accurately.

        )

    });
  });

## Run tests and generate coverage reports

To run your tests, use:

```console title="Terminal"
npm run test
```

To generate a coverage report, use:

```console title="Terminal"
npm run coverage
```

This will run your tests and produce a detailed coverage report, helping you identify any untested parts of your contract.
