The Stacks Explorer lets you explore on-chain data, troubleshoot pending transactions, edit and deploy contracts via the sandbox, discover new tokens, and more. We maintain and support the [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.hiro.so) as a service for the community, but you can also run your own instance of the explorer.

<div className="flex gap-4">
