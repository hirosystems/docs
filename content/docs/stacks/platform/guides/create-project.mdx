In this guide, you'll discover how to easily create a new project or import an existing project from GitHub within the [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/).

After you log in, you'll land on the `/projects` page. This is where you can either create a project from scratch, choose an example project, or import one from GitHub.

### Create a new project

To start a new project, you can begin with a blank project or by choosing one of the example projects provided. The selections includes options such as:

- [Hello world](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-examples/tree/main/examples/hello-world)
- [Fungible token](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-examples/tree/main/examples/fungible-token) and [Non-fungible token](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-examples/tree/main/examples/non-fungible-token)
- [Counter](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-examples/tree/main/examples/counter) 
- [DeFi](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-examples/tree/main/examples/stx-defi) 

For this example, you are going to create a new project using the **Counter** template.

For the rest of the examples, check out the [Clarity examples](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-examples/tree/main/examples) repo.
</Callout>

Starting on the `/projects` page:

1. Click on the **New project** button.
2. In the template section, browse the examples. Look for the **Counter** template and select it.

When you select the **Counter** template, you'll be taken to a new project page as the template will automatically be cloned and displayed.

Here, you can see a list of contracts with a `.clar` extension.

On the right hand side of the interface, you can start editing your smart contracts, which will be validated in real-time.

To add a new contract, you can click on the **Create Contract** button that sits on the left hand side of the interface above your existing contracts.

With a new project now created, you'll now see it on the `/projects` page. Here, you can manage all your projects.

### Import a project from GitHub

Similar to creating a new project manually, after cloning, you will be redirected to your project page.

Here, you'll see a list of all Clarity contracts with a `.clar` extension, showcased here:
