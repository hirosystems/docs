## Why use the Stacks Testnet Faucet?

However, sourcing these tokens can often be cumbersome. The Stacks Testnet Faucet simplifies this by offering a hassle-free way to acquire STX tokens for testing purposes.

## How to request testnet STX

1. **Visit the faucet page**: Navigate to [platform.hiro.so/faucet](https://platform.hiro.so/faucet).
2. **Select the token**: Select which token you want, either STX or sBTC.
3. **Request tokens**: You'll find a straightforward interface with a button to request tokens. Simply click on the button "Receive x STX/sBTC."
4. **Receive 500 STX tokens or 1 sBTC**: By clicking the button, you'll receive 500 STX tokens or 1 sBTC to your testnet account.

## Frequently Asked Questions


<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What is a faucet?">
A faucet is an application that dispenses free tokens on a Testnet (a blockchain network used for development and testing). The Stacks faucet provides developers with free test tokens for deploying, testing, and optimizing smart contracts that leverage STX and sBTC.

**It's important to remember that Testnet tokens have no real-world value and cannot be sold or used on the main Stacks network.**
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does the faucet work?">
Select the type of test token you wish to receive and enter the wallet address where you want to receive them. The faucet will create a transaction on the Stacks Testnet that sends a small amount of test tokens to the provided address.

If you're curious, you can track the transaction's status using [Stacks Explorer](https://explorer.stacks.so/).
