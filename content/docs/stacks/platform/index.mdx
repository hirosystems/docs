- **[Clarinet](/stacks/clarinet)**: Build and deploy smart contracts locally on your device with Clarinet.
- **[Chainhook](/stacks/chainhook)**: You don’t need the platform to create event streams. Leverage chainhook independently, so your app can react to on-chain events in real time.
- **[Stacks.js](/stacks/stacks.js)**: Don’t reinvent the wheel. Build faster with a JS library that handles basic functions.
