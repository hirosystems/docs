## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Generate a predicate file
    
    Chainhook uses predicates to define what blockchain events to track. Generate a template predicate file:

    ```terminal
    $ chainhook predicates new stx-transfer.json --stacks
    ```

    This creates a boilerplate JSON file with the basic predicate structure. The `--stacks` flag specifies you're tracking Stacks events (use `--bitcoin` for Bitcoin).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure event tracking
    
    Open `stx-transfer.json` and update the `if_this` section to track STX transfer events:

    ```json stx-transfer.json
    {
      "chain": "stacks",
      "uuid": "87ac9bff-1052-4d02-9c79-3768a6f08a09",
      "name": "STX Transfer",
      "version": 1,
      "networks": {
        "mainnet": {
          "start_block": 154670,
          "if_this": {
            "scope": "stx_event",
            "actions": ["transfer"]
          },
          "then_that": {
            "file_append": {
              "path": "stx-transfers.txt"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This predicate will:
    - Track all STX transfer events (`scope: "stx_event"`, `actions: ["transfer"]`)
    - Start scanning from block 154670
    - Append matching events to `stx-transfers.txt`
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Scan for events
    
    Run the scan command to search historical blockchain data:

    ```terminal
    $ chainhook predicates scan stx-transfer.json --mainnet
    ```

    :::callout
    The first `scan` downloads a chainstate archive from Hiro Archive. Subsequent scans use the cached data for faster performance.
    :::
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### View results
    
    Check the output file to see the transfer events:

    ```terminal
    $ head -5 stx-transfers.txt
    ```

    Each line contains a JSON payload with transfer details including sender, recipient, amount, and block information.
  </Step>
</Steps>
