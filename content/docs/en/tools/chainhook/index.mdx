**Chainhook 2.0 Beta**: Chainhook 2.0 is currently in beta. During this period, we're focused on learning about reliability, performance, and developer experience. If you encounter issues or have feedback, please reach out to [support@hiro.so](mailto:support@hiro.so).

## Overview

Chainhook is a reorg-aware indexer that lets you build custom event streams from Bitcoin and Stacks blockchains. Unlike traditional indexers, Chainhook automatically handles blockchain reorganizations, ensuring your data stays accurate without manual reindexing.

With Chainhook 2.0, you can manage chainhooks through:
- **[Chainhook SDK](/tools/chainhook/chainhook-sdk)** - TypeScript/JavaScript client for programmatic management
- **[Hiro Platform](/tools/chainhook/platform-usage)** - Web-based UI for visual chainhook creation
- **[Chainhook API](/apis/chainhook-api)** - Direct REST API access

To explore Chainhook features with AI, copy and paste [llms.txt](/tools/chainhook/llms.txt) into your LLM of choice.
