## Overview

Chainhook is a configurable webhook service that lets you filter the Stacks blockchain for specific events and stream the data to your application.

With Chainhook 2.0, you can manage chainhooks through:

- **[Chainhook API](/apis/chainhook-api)** - Direct REST API access

## Key Features

- **Reorg-aware indexing** - Automatically handles blockchain forks and reorganizations
- **Event filtering** - Define custom logic to trigger actions on specific blockchain events
- **Historical evaluation** - Test chainhooks against past blocks for indexing or debugging
