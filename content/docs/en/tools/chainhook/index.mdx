### Chainhook 2.0 Beta
Chainhook 2.0 is currently in beta. If you encounter issues or have feedback, please reach out to [beta@hiro.so](mailto:beta@hiro.so).
:::

## Overview

Chainhook makes it easy to subscribe to blockchain activity on Stacks by registering event streams, filtering for exactly the data you care about, and sending it straight to your app in real time.

With Chainhook 2.0, you can manage chainhooks through:
- **[Chainhook SDK](/tools/chainhook/chainhook-sdk)** - TypeScript/JavaScript client for programmatic management
- **[Hiro Platform](/tools/chainhook/platform-usage)** - Web-based UI for visual chainhook creation
- **[Chainhook API](/apis/chainhook-api)** - Direct REST API access

## Key Features

- **Reorg-aware indexing** - Automatically handles blockchain forks and reorganizations
- **Event filtering** - Define custom logic to trigger actions on specific blockchain events
- **Historical evaluation** - Test chainhooks against past blocks for indexing or debugging
