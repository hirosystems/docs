## Version Management

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="v1-legacy">
    <AccordionTrigger>What will happen to existing legacy Chainhooks running on v1.0?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
Users with Chainhooks running on v1.0 will still be able to view them and receive deliveries, but once the beta launches, all new Chainhooks created in the Platform will run on v2.0.

The API will also not support Chainhooks running on v1.0.

  <AccordionItem value="v1-v2-access">
    <AccordionTrigger>If v2.0 and v1.0 will be live at the same time, how do we manage both?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
In the Platform, v1 chainhooks are read-only. You can view them and they will continue to deliver events, but you cannot modify them through the Platform UI.

To modify v1 chainhooks programmatically, use the [Platform API](/apis/platform-api). However, we recommend migrating to v2 chainhooks instead. See the [Migration Guide](/tools/chainhooks/migration) for a complete walkthrough.

        To migrate your v1 chainhooks to v2, follow the steps outlined in the [Migration Guide](/tools/chainhooks/migration).

## Platform vs SDK

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="edit-chainhooks">
    <AccordionTrigger>Can I edit my v2 Chainhooks?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
Yes! you can edit your v2 Chainhooks using the [Chainhooks SDK](/tools/chainhooks/update) or [Chainhooks API](/apis/chainhooks-api). The Platform does not currently support editing v2 Chainhooks.

## Common Questions

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="multiple-filters">
    <AccordionTrigger>Can I filter by multiple event types?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
        Yes! See examples in the [Filter reference](/tools/chainhooks/reference/filters#combining-filters) guide for examples of combining filters.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="endpoint-down">
    <AccordionTrigger>What happens if my webhook endpoint is down?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
Chainhooks will retry webhook deliveries and then "pause" your Chainhooks, giving you time to fix the issue and re-enable. Extended downtime may result in missed events, but you can use the [Evaluate](/tools/chainhooks/evaluate) feature to replay missed blocks.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="test-locally">
    <AccordionTrigger>Can I test chainhooks locally?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
        Currently, no. But we are working on a new feature that will help you quickly test chainhook payloads locally without requiring much setup.
