## Usage

The Stacks Node RPC API provides direct access to Stacks blockchain nodes through RPC endpoints, built on REST principles and enforcing HTTPS for all requests to ensure data security, integrity, and privacy.

### Base URL

```console -c
https://api.hiro.so
```

### Making requests

To make a request to the Stacks Node RPC API, you can paste the curl command below in your terminal.

```terminal
$ curl -L 'https://api.hiro.so/v2/info' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

### Authentication

If you are using an api-key, replace `$HIRO_API_KEY` with your secret API key.

```terminal
$ curl -L 'https://api.hiro.so/v2/info' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: $HIRO_API_KEY'
```

## Response codes

The Stacks Node RPC API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate request success or failure.

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200` | Successful request |
| `400` | Check that the parameters were correct |
| `401` | Missing API key |
| `403` | Invalid API key |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded |
| `5xx` | Server errors |

## Real-time data

Unlike cached APIs, the RPC endpoints provide direct access to blockchain state:

- Smart contract calls return current state
- Block data reflects the latest confirmed blocks
- Transaction details include real-time status

## Common use cases

- **Smart contract development** - Test and debug contract functions
- **Real-time monitoring** - Track blockchain state changes as they occur  
- **Node operations** - Perform administrative and diagnostic operations
- **Transaction broadcasting** - Submit transactions directly to the network
