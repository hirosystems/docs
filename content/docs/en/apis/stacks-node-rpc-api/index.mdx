## Overview

The Stacks Node RPC API provides direct access to Stacks blockchain nodes through RPC endpoints. These endpoints offer real-time access to blockchain state, smart contract execution, and node operations without intermediary caching layers.

## Key features

- **Direct node access** - Connect directly to Stacks nodes for real-time data
- **Smart contract interaction** - Execute read-only functions and retrieve contract state
- **Block and transaction data** - Access detailed block information and transaction details
- **Network operations** - Perform network-level operations like broadcasting transactions

## Usage

```terminal
$ curl -L 'https://api.hiro.so/v2/info' -H 'Accept: application/json'
```
