Use this endpoint to replay a single block (historical) against an existing chainhook so you can debug delivery issues, re-run missed events, or backfill data after a filter change. Provide either a `block_height` or `index_block_hash` to pinpoint the block you evaluate.

The evaluation job returns `204 No Content`; if your filters match, the webhook payload is delivered to the hook's configured action just like a live event.
