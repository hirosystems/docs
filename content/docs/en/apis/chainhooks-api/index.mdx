## Overview

The Chainhooks API is a REST API that allows you to programmatically manage chainhooks, configure event filters, and control webhook delivery. It provides the same functionality covered in the [Chainhooks SDK introduction](/tools/chainhooks/introduction) through direct HTTP requests.

## Key Features

- **Full chainhook management** - Create, read, update, and delete chainhooks
- **Webhook configuration** - Set up HTTP POST endpoints for event delivery
- **Evaluation endpoints** - Test chainhooks against historical blocks

## Base URLs

The Chainhooks API is available on both mainnet and testnet:

```
Testnet: https://api.testnet.hiro.so/chainhooks/v1
Mainnet: https://api.mainnet.hiro.so/chainhooks/v1
```
