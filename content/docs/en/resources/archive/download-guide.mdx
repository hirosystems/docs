title: How to download Hiro archives
description: Comprehensive guide for downloading large archive files reliably with troubleshooting tips.
---

## Overview

Hiro Archive files are large datasets (ranging from several GB to over 300GB) hosted on Google Cloud Storage. Due to their size, downloads can be interrupted by network issues, rate limits, or connection timeouts. This guide provides multiple download methods and troubleshooting solutions.

## File sizes and requirements

Before downloading, ensure you have sufficient:
- **Disk space**: Archives range from 10GB (APIs) to 321GB+ (blockchain data)
- **Bandwidth**: Downloads can take hours or days depending on your connection
- **Storage for extraction**: Archives expand significantly when extracted

## Download methods

### Method 1: wget with resume (Recommended for most users)

The `wget` command with the `-c` flag enables resuming interrupted downloads:

:::callout

### macOS Users
You may need to install wget first: `brew install wget`. Alternatively, use the curl method below which is pre-installed on macOS.
:::

```terminal
$ wget -c https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz
$ wget -c --progress=bar:force:noscroll https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz
```

**Advantages:**
- Resumes interrupted downloads automatically
- Built into most Unix systems
- Simple to use

**Disadvantages:**
- Single-threaded downloads
- May still experience connection resets

### Method 2: curl with retries

Use `curl` with automatic retries for robust downloads:

```terminal
$ curl -C - -O https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz
$ curl -C - --retry 10 --retry-delay 5 --retry-max-time 0 \
  --progress-bar \
  -o mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz \
  https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz
```

**Advantages:**
- Automatic retry mechanism
- Resume capability with `-C -`
- More configuration options

### Method 3: gcloud storage cp (Fastest, requires authentication)

Google Cloud CLI provides the fastest download speeds with parallel transfers:

```terminal
$ gcloud auth login
$ gcloud storage cp gs://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz .
$ gcloud storage cp gs://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz - | tar -xz
```

**Advantages:**
- Significantly faster downloads (2-3x speed improvement)
- Built-in parallel transfers
- Automatic retry handling
- Can stream directly to extraction

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires Google account authentication
- Additional software installation needed

### Method 4: Download managers (JDownloader)

For users who prefer GUI applications or need advanced download management:

1. Download and install [JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org/download/index)
2. Copy the archive URL into JDownloader
3. Configure parallel connections for faster downloads

**Advantages:**
- Graphical interface
- Parallel downloading
- Advanced retry mechanisms
- Cross-platform support

## Verification and extraction

After downloading, verify the file integrity (available for blockchain archives only):

:::callout

### Checksum Availability
SHA256 checksum files are currently only available for **blockchain archives**. API archives do not have checksum files for verification.
:::

1. **Download the checksum file (blockchain archives only):**
   ```terminal
   $ wget https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.sha256
   ```

2. **Verify the download:**
   ```terminal
   $ echo "$(cat mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.sha256 | awk '{print $1}')  mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256 -c
   ```

3. **Extract the archive:**
   ```terminal
   $ tar -zxvf mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz -C /target/directory
   ```

:::callout

### Large file extraction
The `marf.sqlite.blobs` file can be very large and may take significant time to extract. Ensure you have sufficient disk space and be patient during extraction.

## Performance tips

1. **Use gcloud for fastest downloads** - requires authentication but provides significant speed improvements
2. **Download during off-peak hours** - typically late night or early morning
3. **Use wired connections** - avoid Wi-Fi for large downloads when possible
4. **Monitor disk space** - extracted archives can be 2-3x larger than compressed files
5. **Consider streaming extraction** with gcloud to save disk space
