title: How to download Hiro archives
description: Comprehensive guide for downloading large archive files reliably with troubleshooting tips.
---

## Overview

Hiro Archive files are large datasets (ranging from several GB to several _hundred_ GB) hosted on Google Cloud Storage. Due to their size, downloads can be interrupted by network issues, rate limits, or connection timeouts. This guide provides multiple download methods and troubleshooting solutions.

## File sizes and requirements

Before downloading, ensure you have sufficient:
- **Disk space**: Archives range from 10GB (APIs) to several hundred GB+ (blockchain data)
- **Bandwidth**: Downloads can take hours or days depending on your connection
- **Storage for extraction**: Archives expand significantly when extracted

## Download methods

### Method 1: wget with resume (Recommended for most users)

The `wget` command with the `-c` flag enables resuming interrupted downloads:

:::callout
type: info
### macOS Users
You may need to install wget first: `brew install wget`. Alternatively, use the curl method below which is pre-installed on macOS.
:::

```terminal
$ wget -c https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.zst
$ wget -c --progress=bar:force:noscroll https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.zst
```

**Advantages:**
- Resumes interrupted downloads automatically
- Built into most Unix systems
- Simple to use

**Disadvantages:**
- Single-threaded downloads
- May still experience connection resets

### Method 2: curl with retries

Use `curl` with automatic retries for robust downloads. The `--continue-at -` flag resumes partial downloads, while `--output` specifies the filename:

```terminal
$ curl --continue-at - --retry 10 --retry-delay 5 --retry-max-time 0 \
  --progress-bar \
  --output mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.zst \
  https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.zst
```

**Advantages:**
- Automatic retry mechanism
- Resume capability with `-C -`
- More configuration options

### Method 3: gcloud storage cp (Fastest, requires authentication)

Google Cloud CLI provides the fastest download speeds with parallel transfers. First authenticate with `gcloud auth login`, then either download the file to disk or stream directly to extraction:

#### Download file to current directory

```terminal
$ gcloud storage cp gs://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.zst .
```

#### OR stream directly to extraction (saves disk space but slower due to sequential download, zst extension requires zstd installed)

```terminal
$ gcloud storage cp gs://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.zst - | tar -I zstd -xv
```
Or for older backups with the tar.gz extention:
```terminal
$ gcloud storage cp gs://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz - | tar -zxv
```

**Advantages:**
- Significantly faster downloads (2-3x speed improvement)
- Built-in parallel transfers
- Automatic retry handling
- Can stream directly to extraction (useful when disk space is limited, but disables parallel transfers)

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires Google account authentication
- Additional software installation needed

### Method 4: Download managers (JDownloader)

For users who prefer GUI applications or need advanced download management:

1. Download and install [JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org/download/index)
2. Copy the archive URL into JDownloader
3. Configure parallel connections for faster downloads

**Advantages:**
- Graphical interface
- Parallel downloading
- Advanced retry mechanisms
- Cross-platform support

## Verification and extraction

After downloading, verify the file integrity:

:::callout
type: info
### Checksum Availability
SHA256 checksum files are available for **all archives** to verify download integrity.
:::

1. **Download the checksum file:**
   ```terminal
   $ wget https://archive.hiro.so/mainnet/stacks-blockchain/mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.sha256
   ```

2. **Verify the download:**
   ```terminal
   $ echo "$(cat mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.sha256 | awk '{print $1}')  mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.zst" | shasum -a 256 -c
   ```

3. **Extract the archive (requires zstd-tool to be installed):**
   ```terminal
   $ tar -I zstd -xvf mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.zst
   ```
     Or for older backups with the tar.gz extention:
   ```terminal
   $ tar -zxvf mainnet-stacks-blockchain-latest.tar.gz -C /target/directory
   ```

### Large file extraction
The `marf.sqlite.blobs` file can be very large and may take significant time to extract. Ensure you have sufficient disk space and be patient during extraction.

## Performance tips

1. **Use gcloud for fastest downloads** - requires authentication but provides significant speed improvements
2. **Download during off-peak hours** - typically late night or early morning
3. **Use wired connections** - avoid Wi-Fi for large downloads when possible
4. **Monitor disk space** - extracted archives can be 2-3x larger than compressed files
5. **Consider streaming extraction** with gcloud to save disk space

<Accordion collapsible="true" type="multiple">
  <AccordionItem value="downloads-failing">
    <AccordionTrigger>Why do downloads keep failing?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Large file downloads from cloud storage can be interrupted due to network issues, rate limiting, or connection timeouts. Use resume-capable tools like `wget -c` or `gcloud storage cp`.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="download-method">
    <AccordionTrigger>Which download method should I use?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      For fastest speeds, use `gcloud storage cp` (requires Google auth). For simplicity, use `wget -c`. For reliability without authentication, try a download manager like JDownloader.
