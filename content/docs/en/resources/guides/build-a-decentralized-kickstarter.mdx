import { Code, Terminal } from 'lucide-react';
import { SmallCard } from '@/components/card';

In this guide, you will learn how to create an NFT marketplace that allows users to list NFTs for sale. Users can specify the following details for their listings:
- The NFT token to sell.
- Listing expiry in block height.
- The payment asset, either STX or a SIP010 fungible token.
- The NFT price in the chosen payment asset.
- An optional intended taker. If set, only that principal will be able to fulfil the listing.

This marketplace leverages the following Clarity traits:
- `nft-trait` for handling NFTs.
- `ft-trait` for handling fungible tokens.

Over the course of this guide, you will learn how to:
1. Define and handle errors.
2. Create and manage NFT listings.
3. Whitelist asset contracts.
4. Fulfil NFT purchases.

## Define and handle errors

First, define constants for various errors that may occur during listing, cancelling, or fulfilling NFT transactions. This helps in maintaining clean and readable code.

```clarity
;; Define listing errors
(define-constant ERR_EXPIRY_IN_PAST (err u1000))
(define-constant ERR_PRICE_ZERO (err u1001))

;; Define cancelling and fulfilling errors
(define-constant ERR_UNKNOWN_LISTING (err u2000))
(define-constant ERR_UNAUTHORISED (err u2001))
(define-constant ERR_LISTING_EXPIRED (err u2002))
(define-constant ERR_NFT_ASSET_MISMATCH (err u2003))
(define-constant ERR_PAYMENT_ASSET_MISMATCH (err u2004))
(define-constant ERR_MAKER_TAKER_EQUAL (err u2005))
(define-constant ERR_UNINTENDED_TAKER (err u2006))
(define-constant ERR_ASSET_CONTRACT_NOT_WHITELISTED (err u2007))
(define-constant ERR_PAYMENT_CONTRACT_NOT_WHITELISTED (err u2008))
```

## Create and manage NFT listings

### Define data structures

Create a map data structure for the asset listings and a data variable for unique IDs.

```clarity
;; Define a map data structure for the asset listings
(define-map listings
  uint
  {
    maker: principal,
    taker: (optional principal),
    token-id: uint,
    nft-asset-contract: principal,
    expiry: uint,
    price: uint,
    payment-asset-contract: (optional principal)
  }
)

;; Used for unique IDs for each listing
(define-data-var listing-nonce uint u0)
```

### List an asset

Create a public function to list an asset along with its contract. This function verifies the contract, checks expiry and price, and transfers the NFT ownership to the marketplace.

```clarity
(define-public (list-asset
  (nft-asset-contract <nft-trait>)
  (nft-asset {
    taker: (optional principal),
    token-id: uint,
    expiry: uint,
    price: uint,
    payment-asset-contract: (optional principal)
  })
)
  (let ((listing-id (var-get listing-nonce)))
    ;; Verify that the contract of this asset is whitelisted
    (asserts! (is-whitelisted (contract-of nft-asset-contract)) ERR_ASSET_CONTRACT_NOT_WHITELISTED)
    ;; Verify that the asset is not expired
    (asserts! (> (get expiry nft-asset) block-height) ERR_EXPIRY_IN_PAST)
    ;; Verify that the asset price is greater than zero
    (asserts! (> (get price nft-asset) u0) ERR_PRICE_ZERO)
    ;; Verify that the contract of the payment is whitelisted
    (asserts! (match (get payment-asset-contract nft-asset)
      payment-asset
      (is-whitelisted payment-asset)
      true
    ) ERR_PAYMENT_CONTRACT_NOT_WHITELISTED)
    ;; Transfer the NFT ownership to this contract's principal
    (try! (transfer-nft
      nft-asset-contract
      (get token-id nft-asset)
      tx-sender
      (as-contract tx-sender)
    ))
    ;; List the NFT in the listings map
    (map-set listings listing-id (merge
      { maker: tx-sender, nft-asset-contract: (contract-of nft-asset-contract) }
      nft-asset
    ))
    ;; Increment the nonce to use for the next unique listing ID
    (var-set listing-nonce (+ listing-id u1))
    ;; Return the created listing ID
    (ok listing-id)
  )
)
```

### Retrieve an asset

Create a read-only function to retrieve an asset, or listing, by its ID.

```clarity
(define-read-only (get-listing (listing-id uint))
  (map-get? listings listing-id)
)
```

### Cancel a listing

Create a public function to cancel a listing. Only the NFT's creator can cancel the listing, and it must use the same asset contract that the NFT uses.

```clarity
(define-public (cancel-listing (listing-id uint) (nft-asset-contract <nft-trait>))
  (let (
    (listing (unwrap! (map-get? listings listing-id) ERR_UNKNOWN_LISTING))
    (maker (get maker listing))
  )
    ;; Verify that the caller of the function is the creator of the NFT to be cancelled
    (asserts! (is-eq maker tx-sender) ERR_UNAUTHORISED)
    ;; Verify that the asset contract to use is the same one that the NFT uses
    (asserts! (is-eq
      (get nft-asset-contract listing)
      (contract-of nft-asset-contract)
    ) ERR_NFT_ASSET_MISMATCH)
    ;; Delete the listing
    (map-delete listings listing-id)
    ;; Transfer the NFT from this contract's principal back to the creator's principal
    (as-contract (transfer-nft nft-asset-contract (get token-id listing) tx-sender maker))
  )
)
```

## Whitelist asset contracts

### Whitelist contracts

The marketplace requires any contracts used for assets or payments to be whitelisted by the contract owner. Create a map to store whitelisted asset contracts and a function to check if a contract is whitelisted.

```clarity
(define-map whitelisted-asset-contracts principal bool)

(define-read-only (is-whitelisted (asset-contract principal))
  (default-to false (map-get? whitelisted-asset-contracts asset-contract))
)
```

### Set whitelisted contracts

Only the contract owner can whitelist an asset contract. Create a public function to set whitelisted asset contracts.

```clarity
(define-public (set-whitelisted (asset-contract principal) (whitelisted bool))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq contract-owner tx-sender) ERR_UNAUTHORISED)
    (ok (map-set whitelisted-asset-contracts asset-contract whitelisted))
  )
)
```

## Fulfill NFT purchases

### Fulfill listing with STX

Create a public function to purchase a listing using STX as payment.

```clarity
(define-public (fulfil-listing-stx (listing-id uint) (nft-asset-contract <nft-trait>))
  (let (
    ;; Verify the given listing ID exists
    (listing (unwrap! (map-get? listings listing-id) ERR_UNKNOWN_LISTING))
    ;; Set the NFT's taker to the purchaser (caller of the function)
    (taker tx-sender)
  )
    ;; Validate that the purchase can be fulfilled
    (try! (assert-can-fulfil (contract-of nft-asset-contract) none listing))
    ;; Transfer the NFT to the purchaser (caller of the function)
    (try! (as-contract (transfer-nft nft-asset-contract (get token-id listing) tx-sender taker)))
    ;; Transfer the STX payment from the purchaser to the creator of the NFT
    (try! (stx-transfer? (get price listing) taker (get maker listing)))
    ;; Remove the NFT from the marketplace listings
    (map-delete listings listing-id)
    ;; Return the listing ID that was just purchased
    (ok listing-id)
  )
)
```

### Fulfill listing with SIP-010

Create a public function to purchase a listing using another fungible token that follows the SIP-010 standard as payment.

```clarity
(define-public (fulfil-listing-ft
  (listing-id uint)
  (nft-asset-contract <nft-trait>)
  (payment-asset-contract <ft-trait>)
)
  (let (
    ;; Verify the given listing ID exists
    (listing (unwrap! (map-get? listings listing-id) ERR_UNKNOWN_LISTING))
    ;; Set the NFT's taker to the purchaser (caller of the function)
    (taker tx-sender)
  )
    ;; Validate that the purchase can be fulfilled
    (try! (assert-can-fulfil
      (contract-of nft-asset-contract)
      (some (contract-of payment-asset-contract))
      listing
    ))
    ;; Transfer the NFT to the purchaser (caller of the function)
    (try! (as-contract (transfer-nft nft-asset-contract (get token-id listing) tx-sender taker)))
    ;; Transfer the tokens as payment from the purchaser to the creator of the NFT
    (try! (transfer-ft payment-asset-contract (get price listing) taker (get maker listing)))
    ;; Remove the NFT from the marketplace listings
    (map-delete listings listing-id)
    ;; Return the listing ID that was just purchased
    (ok listing-id)
  )
)
```

### Validate purchase can be fulfilled

Create a private function to validate that a purchase can be fulfilled. This function checks the listing's expiry, the NFT's contract, and the payment's contract.

```clarity
(define-private (assert-can-fulfil
  (nft-asset-contract principal)
  (payment-asset-contract (optional principal))
  (listing {
    maker: principal,
    taker: (optional principal),
    token-id: uint,
    nft-asset-contract: principal,
    expiry: uint,
    price: uint,
    payment-asset-contract: (optional principal)
  })
)
  (begin
    ;; Verify that the buyer is not the same as the NFT creator
    (asserts! (not (is-eq (get maker listing) tx-sender)) ERR_MAKER_TAKER_EQUAL)
    ;; Verify the buyer has been set in the listing metadata as its `taker`
    (asserts!
      (match (get taker listing) intended-taker (is-eq intended-taker tx-sender) true)
      ERR_UNINTENDED_TAKER
    )
    ;; Verify the listing for purchase is not expired
    (asserts! (< block-height (get expiry listing)) ERR_LISTING_EXPIRED)
    ;; Verify the asset contract used to purchase the NFT is the same as the one set on the NFT
    (asserts! (is-eq (get nft-asset-contract listing) nft-asset-contract) ERR_NFT_ASSET_MISMATCH)
    ;; Verify the payment contract used to purchase the NFT is the same as the one set on the NFT
    (asserts!
      (is-eq (get payment-asset-contract listing) payment-asset-contract)
      ERR_PAYMENT_ASSET_MISMATCH
    )
    (ok true)
  )
)
```
