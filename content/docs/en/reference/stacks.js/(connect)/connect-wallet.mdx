Learn how to integrate wallet connections into your Stacks application. Connecting a wallet authenticates users and enables blockchain interactions like transfers and contract calls.

## What you'll learn

:::objectives
- Install the `@stacks/connect` package
- Connect to a wallet and authenticate users
- Manage authentication state
- Access user account data
:::

## Prerequisites

:::prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- A web application setup (React, Vue, or vanilla JS)
- Basic understanding of async/await
:::

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install package

    Add the Stacks Connect package to your project.

    ```package-install
    @stacks/connect
    ```

    This package provides all the functions needed for wallet connections and user authentication.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Connect and authenticate

    The `connect` function initiates wallet connection and stores user data in local storage for session persistence.

    ```ts
    import { connect, isConnected } from '@stacks/connect';

    async function connectWallet() {
      // Check if already connected
      if (isConnected()) {
        console.log('Already authenticated');
        return;
      }

      // Connect to wallet
      const response = await connect();
      console.log('Connected:', response.addresses);
    }
    ```

    Manage the authentication state throughout your app.

    ```ts
    import { disconnect, isConnected } from '@stacks/connect';

    // Check authentication status
    const authenticated = isConnected();

    // Logout function
    function logout() {
      disconnect(); // Clears storage and wallet selection
      console.log('User disconnected');
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Access user data

    Retrieve stored addresses and request detailed account information.

    ```ts
    import { getLocalStorage, request } from '@stacks/connect';

    // Get stored addresses from local storage
    const userData = getLocalStorage();
    if (userData?.addresses) {
      const stxAddress = userData.addresses.stx[0].address;
      const btcAddress = userData.addresses.btc[0].address;
      console.log('STX:', stxAddress);
      console.log('BTC:', btcAddress);
    }
    ```

    Get detailed account information including public keys.

    ```ts
    // Request full account details
    const accounts = await request('stx_getAccounts');
    const account = accounts.addresses[0];

    console.log('Address:', account.address);
    console.log('Public key:', account.publicKey);
    console.log('Gaia URL:', account.gaiaHubUrl);
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Make your first transaction

    Use the authenticated connection to send STX tokens.

    ```ts
    import { request } from '@stacks/connect';

    async function sendTransaction() {
      const response = await request('stx_transferStx', {
        amount: '1000000', // 1 STX in micro-STX
        recipient: 'SP2MF04VAGYHGAZWGTEDW5VYCPDWWSY08Z1QFNDSN',
        memo: 'First transfer', // optional
      });
      
      console.log('Transaction ID:', response.txid);
    }
    ```

    The wallet will prompt the user to approve the transaction before broadcasting.

  </Step>
</Steps>
