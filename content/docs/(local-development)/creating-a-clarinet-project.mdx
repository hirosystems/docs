description: Step-by-step guide to create your first smart contract project with Clarinet
---

Ready to build your first smart contract? Clarinet makes it simple to generate a new project, write Clarity code, and test everything locally. You'll have a working counter contract up and running in minutes.

Think of Clarinet as your smart contract workshop. It gives you project structure, testing tools, and a local blockchain—everything you need to build confidently before deploying to mainnet.

## What You'll Learn

- Generate a new Clarinet project
- Create your first smart contract
- Write basic Clarity functions
- Validate your contract code
- Test contract interactions locally

## What You'll Need

- [Clarinet installed](/docs/setting-up-your-environment/installing-prerequisites)
- Basic terminal knowledge
- 10 minutes for the walkthrough

## Step 1: Generate Your Project

Create a new Clarinet project called `counter`. This sets up everything you need for smart contract development.

```terminal
$ clarinet new counter
Creating directory counter
Created file counter/Clarinet.toml
Created file counter/.gitignore
Created directory counter/contracts
Created directory counter/tests
Created file counter/settings/Devnet.toml
Created file counter/settings/Mainnet.toml  
Created file counter/settings/Testnet.toml
Created file counter/package.json
Created file counter/tsconfig.json
Created file counter/vitest.config.js
```

Navigate into your new project:

```terminal
$ cd counter
```

You now have a complete Clarinet workspace with:
- **contracts/**: Where your Clarity files live
- **tests/**: JavaScript test files
- **settings/**: Network configurations
- **Clarinet.toml**: Project configuration

## Step 2: Create Your First Contract

Generate a new smart contract called `counter` inside your project:

```terminal
$ clarinet contract new counter
Created contracts/counter.clar
```

This command:
- Creates the contract file `contracts/counter.clar`
- Updates `Clarinet.toml` with contract configuration
- Sets up the proper folder structure

Your `Clarinet.toml` now includes:

```toml
[contracts.counter]
path = 'contracts/counter.clar'
clarity_version = 2
epoch = 2.5
```

## Step 3: Write Your Smart Contract

Open `contracts/counter.clar` and add this code:

```clarity
;; Define a map to store counters for each user
(define-map Counters principal uint)

;; Public function to increment a user's counter
(define-public (count-up)
  (ok (map-set Counters tx-sender (+ (get-count tx-sender) u1)))
)

;; Read-only function to get a user's current count
(define-read-only (get-count (who principal))
  (default-to u0 (map-get? Counters who))
)
```

**What this contract does:**
- **Counters map**: Stores a number for each user (principal)
- **count-up function**: Increases the caller's count by 1
- **get-count function**: Returns anyone's current count

Each user gets their own counter that starts at 0 and increments when they call `count-up`.

## Step 4: Validate Your Contract

Check your contract for syntax errors and issues:

```terminal
$ clarinet check
✅ 1 contract checked, no problems found.
```

See the checkmark? Your contract is valid! If you see errors:
- Check for typos in function names
- Make sure parentheses are balanced
- Verify correct Clarity syntax

Common fixes:
- Missing or extra parentheses
- Incorrect function signatures
- Typos in built-in functions

## Step 5: Test Your Contract Locally

Start the Clarinet console to interact with your contract:

```terminal
$ clarinet console
Welcome to Clarinet console.
Type (help) for available commands.
>>
```

**Test the count-up function:**

```clarity
>> (contract-call? .counter count-up)
(ok true)
```

**Check your count:**

```clarity
>> (contract-call? .counter get-count tx-sender)
u1
```

**Increment again:**

```clarity
>> (contract-call? .counter count-up)
(ok true)

>> (contract-call? .counter get-count tx-sender)
u2
```

Perfect! Your counter is working. Each call to `count-up` increases your count by 1.

Hit `Ctrl+C` twice to leave the console.

> **Project Structure**: Your Clarinet project includes contracts for your Clarity code, tests for JavaScript unit tests, settings for network configurations, and Clarinet.toml for project configuration. For a complete breakdown of each file and configuration options, see our [Anatomy of a Clarinet Project](/tools/clarinet/anatomy-of-a-clarinet-project) guide.

## Verification

Let's confirm everything is working:

1. **Project created**: `ls` shows all the project files
2. **Contract valid**: `clarinet check` passes with no errors
3. **Contract interactive**: Console commands return expected results
4. **Functions work**: Counter increments correctly

If any step fails, double-check the contract code and try `clarinet check` again.

## Troubleshooting

**"Command not found: clarinet"**
- Make sure [Clarinet is installed](/docs/setting-up-your-environment/installing-prerequisites)
- Restart your terminal after installation

**"Contract validation failed"**
- Check for syntax errors in your `.clar` file
- Ensure parentheses are balanced
- Look for typos in function names

**"Console not responding"**
- Exit with `Ctrl+C` and try `clarinet console` again
- Make sure you're in your project directory

**"Contract call failed"**
- Verify the contract name matches your file (`.counter`)
- Check function names for typos
- Ensure you're using correct Clarity syntax

## Next Steps

Excellent work! You've created your first smart contract project. Here's what to tackle next:

**Write comprehensive tests**: [Learn unit testing with Clarinet JS SDK](/docs/testing-contracts/unit-testing-clarinet-js-sdk) to ensure your contracts work perfectly.

**Explore advanced patterns**: Check out [Advanced Clarity Patterns](/docs/smart-contracts/advanced-clarity-patterns) to write more sophisticated contracts.

**Run a local blockchain**: Set up [Devnet for local development](/docs/local-development/working-with-devnet) to test with multiple accounts and realistic scenarios.

**Pro tip**: Keep your contracts simple at first. Master the basics like maps, public functions, and read-only functions before moving to complex features like traits and inter-contract calls.
