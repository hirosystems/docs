description: Essential features and setup for the Clarity VS Code extension to streamline smart contract development
---

The Clarity VS Code extension transforms your editor into a powerful smart contract development environment. You'll get syntax highlighting, auto-completion, debugging, and real-time error checking—all the tools you need to write safe Clarity code.

Think of it as your coding copilot. The extension catches errors before you deploy, suggests functions as you type, and shows documentation without leaving your editor.

## Core Features

### Smart Auto-Completion

Start typing any Clarity function and get instant suggestions with documentation. The extension adds parentheses and creates placeholders for function arguments.

```clarity
;; Type "stx-tr" and get:
(stx-transfer? amount sender recipient)
;;             ^      ^      ^
;;             Placeholders for easy navigation
```

Use `Tab` to jump between placeholders. Use `Escape` to exit placeholder mode.

### Documentation on Hover

Hover over any Clarity function or keyword to see its documentation. No need to switch tabs or search external docs.

```clarity
;; Hover over 'map-set' to see:
;; - Function signature
;; - Parameter descriptions  
;; - Return type
;; - Usage examples
(map-set my-map {key: "value"} "data")
```

### Go-to Definition

Jump to function, constant, or variable definitions instantly:

- `F12` or `Ctrl+Click` to go to definition
- `Alt+F12` to peek definition without leaving current file
- Works across contract files and contract calls

### Real-Time Error Checking

The extension validates your code on every save. You'll see:

- **Red squiggles**: Syntax errors, unknown keywords
- **Yellow squiggles**: Warnings for potentially unsafe code
- **Error list**: All issues in the Problems panel (`Ctrl+Shift+M`)

Common errors caught:
- Undefined variables or functions
- Type mismatches
- Missing trait implementations
- Invalid function signatures

### Local Contract Resolution

Auto-completion works across your entire project. Reference functions from other contracts in your workspace:

```clarity
;; Auto-complete local contract calls
(contract-call? .my-token transfer amount sender recipient)
;;               ^
;;               Suggests contracts in your project
```

### Trait Support

When implementing traits (like SIP-009 NFTs or SIP-010 tokens), the extension verifies:

- All required functions are implemented
- Function signatures match trait definitions
- Return types are correct

```clarity
;; Extension warns if missing required trait functions
(impl-trait .sip-010-trait.sip-010-trait)

;; ⚠️ Warning: Missing required function 'get-balance'
```

## Debugging Support

The extension includes a visual debugger for step-by-step code execution.

**Requirements:**
- VS Code Desktop (doesn't work in web version)
- [Clarinet installed locally](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet#installation)

**How to debug:**

1. Set breakpoints by clicking line numbers
2. Press `F5` or use Run → Start Debugging
3. Step through code line-by-line
4. Inspect variables and stack state

The debugger shows you exactly how Clarity executes your functions, making it easier to understand complex logic and catch bugs.

## Configuration Options

### File Associations

The extension automatically recognizes `.clar` files. For custom extensions:

```json
// settings.json
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.clarity": "clarity"
  }
}
```

### Formatting

Enable format-on-save for consistent code style:

```json
// settings.json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "[clarity]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "HiroSystems.clarity-lsp"
  }
}
```

### Error Checking Frequency

Adjust how often the extension checks for errors:

```json
// settings.json
{
  "clarity.checkOnSave": true,
  "clarity.checkOnType": false
}
```

## Best Practices

**Organize your workspace**
- Keep all contract files in your Clarinet project root
- Use descriptive filenames that match contract names
- Group related contracts in subdirectories

**Use the extension's power**
- Hover before assuming—check function documentation
- Let auto-completion guide you to valid function names
- Pay attention to error squiggles; they catch real issues

**Debugging workflow**
- Start with simple functions before debugging complex ones
- Use breakpoints strategically at decision points
- Check variable values at each step

**Performance tips**
- Close unused Clarity files to improve responsiveness
- For large projects, consider workspace-specific settings
- Restart the extension (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Restart Extension Host") if it becomes slow

## Troubleshooting

**Extension not recognizing files?**
- Ensure files have `.clar` extension
- Check if you're in a Clarinet project directory
- Restart VS Code

**Auto-completion not working?**
- Verify the language server is running (check status bar)
- Try reloading the window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window")

**Debugger won't start?**
- Confirm Clarinet is installed: `clarinet --version`
- Make sure you're using VS Code Desktop, not web
- Check that your project has a valid `Clarinet.toml`
