Syncing a Bitcoin node is often one of the first steps a developer takes when building a Bitcoin application. It's a great introduction to the Bitcoin developer ecosystem, and if you're relying on onchain data, there's no safer way to get that data than doing it yourself.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. Download Bitcoin Core daemon on your machine
2. Configure `bitcoind`
3. Start syncing your node
4. Properly shutdown and restart your node

<Callout>
To get started, we first need to download `bitcoind`. In our example, we'll be using version 25.0. You can select a software version compatible with your device [from this list](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0). 
</Callout>

---

### Configure <InlineCode>bitcoind</InlineCode>

Once your download is complete, make note of your path to the `bitcoind` executable.

<Callout>
When you sync your node, we'll be running the program at `/bitcoin-25.0/bin/bitcoin`, which is where the `bitcoind` executable is located.
</Callout>

Next up is a couple configuration steps.

1. Select or create a directory to store your Bitcoin data.
2. Update the `bitcoin.conf` file to include the path to your Bitcoin data directory.

The Bitcoin chainstate is pretty large, and you need a place to store it. In this example, we are going to set up a directory called `bitcoin-data` on an external hard drive that we have mounted at `/Volumes/SSD`.

<Callout>
  This folder, `bitcoin-data`, can be named whatever you like, and can exist locally or in an external hard drive.
  
  The most important part being that it should exist in a place that has enough storage to hold all the Bitcoin data we will be receiving once it starts to sync.
</Callout>

Now navigate to your `bitcoin.conf` file, which is located in your `/path/to/bitcoin` directory and update the `datadir` field with your directory. 

For our example, it would look like this:

```bash title="bitcoin.conf"
datadir=/Volumes/SSD/bitcoin-data/
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Example bitcoin.conf">
You can override the default configuration with the following, including the path to where you will be storing all of the Bitcoin data once it starts syncing:

```bash title="bitcoin.conf"
# [!code word:rpcuser]
# [!code word:rpcpassword]
datadir=/your-path-to/bitcoin-data/ # [!code highlight]
server=1
rpcuser=devnet
rpcpassword=devnet
rpcport=8332
rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0
rpcallowip=::/0
txindex=1
listen=1
discover=0
dns=0
dnsseed=0
listenonion=0
rpcserialversion=1
disablewallet=0
fallbackfee=0.00001
rpcthreads=8
blocksonly=1
dbcache=4096

# Start zeromq
zmqpubhashblock=tcp://0.0.0.0:18543
```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

If you plan to use your node to receive transactions, you will need to make note of the `username` and `password` fields for your node.

<Callout>
In the example `bitcoin.conf` above, `devnet` is listed as the default `username` and `password`.
</Callout>

### Run the node

Now that you've finished configuring your `bitcoin.conf` file, it's time to start up your node.

This takes the form of `path/to/bitcoind -conf=path/to/bitcoin.conf`, which in our example looks like:

```bash
/Volumes/SSD/bitcoin-25.0/bin/bitcoind -conf=/Volumes/SSD/bitcoin-25.0/bitcoin.conf
```

After running this command, you will see `zmq_url` entries in your console's stdout, displaying ZeroMQ logs from your Bitcoin node. Congrats! You're now syncing!

<Callout>
It might take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to run and fully sync, depending on if it's your first time syncing a node.
</Callout>

### Proper shutdown and restart procedure

It's important to know how to properly shut down your `bitcoind` node so that you can start them back up where you've left off on another machine or at another time.

Here's a few common practices to follow to ensure that doesn't happen:

1. Shutting down your node
2. Ejecting your external hard drive
3. Restarting your node

To shut down your node safely, use the `bitcoin-cli` executable inside of the `bin` directory to run the following command:

```bash
/path/to/bitcoin-cli \
  --conf=/path/to/bitcoin.conf \
  --rpcuser={{your-rpc-username}} \
  --rpcpassword={{your-rpc-password}} stop
```

To eject your hard drive safely (if applicable):

<Tabs items={["macOS","Windows"]}>
  <Tab value={"macOS"}>
    1. Go to the Finder, then the sidebar, and select the disk you want to eject under “Devices”. Click on the eject icon next to the name.
    2. Wait for a confirmation message saying it's safe to eject the device before you unplug the drive.
  </Tab>

  <Tab value={"Windows"}>
    1. Open File Explorer, select the drive from the list under “This PC” (PC > Devices and Drives), and click the “Eject” button.
    2. Wait for a confirmation message saying it's safe to eject the device before you unplug the drive.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

To start your node back up, all you need to do is refer to the previous steps from above by running `path/to/bitcoind -conf=path/to/bitcoin.conf`.
