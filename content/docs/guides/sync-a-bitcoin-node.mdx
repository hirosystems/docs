Syncing a Bitcoin node is often one of the first steps a developer takes when building a Bitcoin application. It's a great introduction to the Bitcoin developer ecosystem, and if you're relying on on-chain data, there's no safer way to get that data than doing it yourself.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. Download Bitcoin Core daemon on your machine
2. Configure `bitcoind`
3. Start syncing your node
4. Properly shutdown and restart your node

<Callout>
To get started, we first need to download `bitcoind`. In our example, we'll be using version 25.0. You can select a software version compatible with your device [from this list](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-25.0). 
</Callout>

---

### Configure <InlineCode>bitcoind</InlineCode>

Once your download is complete, make note of your path to the `bitcoind` executable.

<Callout>
When you sync your node, we'll be running the program at `/bitcoin-25.0/bin/bitcoin`, which is where the `bitcoind` executable is located.
</Callout>

Next up is a couple configuration steps.

1. Select or create a directory to store your Bitcoin data.
2. Update the `bitcoin.conf` file to include the path to your Bitcoin data directory.

The Bitcoin chainstate is pretty large, and you need a place to store it. In this example, we are going to set up a directory called `bitcoin-data` on an external hard drive that we have mounted at `/Volumes/SSD`.

<Callout>
  This folder, `bitcoin-data`, can be named whatever you like, and can exist locally or in an external hard drive.
  
  The most important thing is that it should exist in a place that has enough storage to hold all the Bitcoin data we will be receiving once it starts to sync.
</Callout>

Now navigate to your `bitcoin.conf` file, which is located in your `/path/to/bitcoin` directory and update the `datadir` field with your directory. 

In this example, it would look like this:

```bash title="bitcoin.conf"
datadir=/Volumes/SSD/bitcoin-data/
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Example bitcoin.conf">
You can override the default configuration with the following, including the path to where you will be storing all of the Bitcoin data once it starts syncing:

```bash title="bitcoin.conf"
# [!code word:rpcuser]
# [!code word:rpcpassword]
datadir=/your-path-to/bitcoin-data/ # [!code highlight]
server=1
rpcuser=devnet
rpcpassword=devnet
rpcport=8332
rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0
rpcallowip=::/0
txindex=1
listen=1
discover=0
dns=0
dnsseed=0
listenonion=0
rpcserialversion=1
disablewallet=0
fallbackfee=0.00001
rpcthreads=8
blocksonly=1
dbcache=4096

# Start zeromq
zmqpubhashblock=tcp://0.0.0.0:18543
```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

If you plan to use your node to receive transactions, you will need to make note of the `username` and `password` fields for your node.

<Callout>
In the example `bitcoin.conf` above, `devnet` is listed as the default `username` and `password`.
</Callout>

### Run the node

With a finished `bitcoin.conf` file, it's time to start up your node.

This takes the form of `path/to/bitcoind -conf=path/to/bitcoin.conf`, which in this example looks like:

```bash
/Volumes/SSD/bitcoin-25.0/bin/bitcoind -conf=/Volumes/SSD/bitcoin-25.0/bitcoin.conf
```

After running this command, you will see `zmq_url` entries in your console's stdout, displaying ZeroMQ logs from your Bitcoin node. Congrats! You're now syncing!

<Callout>
It might take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to run and fully sync, depending on if it's your first time syncing a node.
</Callout>

### Proper shutdown and restart procedure

1. Shutting down your node
2. Restarting your node

To shut down your node safely, use the `bitcoin-cli` executable, located inside of the `bin` directory, and run the `stop` command:

```bash
/path/to/bitcoin-cli \
  --conf=/path/to/bitcoin.conf \
  --rpcuser={{your-rpc-username}} \
  --rpcpassword={{your-rpc-password}} stop
```

To start your node back up, all you need to do is refer to the previous steps from above by running `path/to/bitcoind -conf=path/to/bitcoin.conf`.

    <Tab value={"macOS"}>
      1. Go to the Finder, then the sidebar, and select the disk you want to eject under “Devices”. Click on the eject icon next to the name.
      2. Wait for a confirmation message saying it's safe to eject the device before you unplug the drive.
    </Tab>

    <Tab value={"Windows"}>
      1. Open File Explorer, select the drive from the list under “This PC” (PC > Devices and Drives), and click the “Eject” button.
      2. Wait for a confirmation message saying it's safe to eject the device before you unplug the drive.
