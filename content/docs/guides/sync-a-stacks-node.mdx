Running a Stacks node is crucial for developers aiming to interact directly with the Stacks blockchain. It allows for the verification of transactions, ensures decentralized operations, and enhances blockchain security.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. Clone the Stacks blockchain Docker repository.
2. Start the service.
3. Monitor the node's synchronization process.

---

### Prerequisites

If you haven't already, refer to the [how to install Docker](/guides/how-to-install-docker) guide to proceed.

---

### Clone the Stacks blockchain Docker repository

Clone the Stacks blockchain Docker repository from GitHub:

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain-docker.git
cd stacks-blockchain-docker
```

### Start the service

Inside of the `stacks-blockchain-docker` directory, run the following command to start the Stacks node:

```bash title="Terminal"
./manage.sh -n <network> -a start
```

The `<network>` placeholder used below can be replaced with one of:

- `mainnet`
- `testnet`
- `mocknet`

### Monitor the node's synchronization process

To follow the logs for the Stacks node, run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
./manage.sh -n <network> -a logs
```

For networks other than `mocknet`, downloading the initial headers can take several minutes. Until the headers are downloaded, the `/v2/info` endpoints won't return any data.
