description: Apply a function to each element of a list in Clarity smart contracts.

## Function Signature

```clarity
(map function list)
```

- Input: `(function (A) => B)`, `(list A)`
- Output: `(list B)`

## Why it matters

The `map` function is crucial for:

1. Applying a function to each element of a list.
2. Transforming lists by applying operations to their elements.
3. Simplifying the process of performing bulk operations on lists.
4. Enhancing code readability and maintainability by abstracting repetitive operations.

## When to use it

Use `map` when you need to:

- Apply a function to each element of a list.
- Transform a list by applying operations to its elements.
- Perform bulk operations on lists.
- Simplify and abstract repetitive operations on list elements.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the function being applied is compatible with the elements of the list.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other list functions for comprehensive list handling.
- Be aware of the performance implications of applying functions to large lists.

## Practical Example: Doubling Each Element in a List

Let's implement a function that doubles each element in a list of integers:

```clarity
(define-private (double (n int))
  (* n 2)
)

(define-read-only (double-elements (numbers (list 10 int)))
  (map double numbers)
)

;; Usage
(double-elements (list 1 2 3 4 5)) ;; Returns (list 2 4 6 8 10)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Defining a private function `double` to double an integer.
2. Using `map` to apply the `double` function to each element in a list.
3. Implementing a read-only function to return the transformed list.
4. Handling both small and large input lists.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `map` with incompatible function and list element types, causing type errors.
2. Assuming the list will always be within a certain length, leading to unhandled cases.
3. Not handling all possible conditions, resulting in incomplete list transformations.
4. Overlooking the need for proper error handling and validation.

## Related Functions

- `filter`: Filters elements of a list based on a predicate function.
- `fold`: Reduces a list to a single value by applying a function.
- `len`: Returns the length of a list.

## Conclusion

The `map` function is a fundamental tool for applying functions to each element of a list in Clarity smart contracts. It allows you to transform lists, perform bulk operations, and simplify repetitive tasks. When used effectively, `map` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to manage list transformations.
