description: Compute the SHA-256 hash of a value in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(sha256 value)
```

- Input: `buff | uint | int`
- Output: `(buff 32)`

## Why it matters

The `sha256` function is crucial for:

1. Computing the SHA-256 hash of a given value.
2. Implementing cryptographic operations in smart contracts.
3. Ensuring data integrity by generating unique hashes.
4. Simplifying the process of handling cryptographic hashing in smart contracts.

## When to use it

Use `sha256` when you need to:

- Compute the SHA-256 hash of a given value.
- Implement cryptographic operations in your smart contract.
- Generate unique hashes to ensure data integrity.
- Handle cryptographic hashing operations.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the input value is correctly formatted and valid.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other cryptographic functions for comprehensive security management.
- Handle the possible error cases to ensure robust contract behavior.

## Practical Example: Computing a SHA-256 Hash

Let's implement a function that computes the SHA-256 hash of a given buffer:

```clarity
(define-read-only (compute-sha256 (input (buff 32)))
  (sha256 input)
)

;; Usage
(compute-sha256 0x68656c6c6f20776f726c64000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
;; Returns 0x28effae679c457da1e5158c063b3dfa78d0ade721b9aa9f1fc3f46dba4c0ea15
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `sha256` to compute the hash of a given buffer.
2. Implementing a public function to handle the hash computation.
3. Handling both successful and error cases.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `sha256` with incorrectly formatted or invalid input values, causing the operation to fail.
2. Assuming the hash will always be valid, leading to unhandled error cases.
3. Not handling all possible conditions, resulting in incomplete cryptographic hashing.
4. Overlooking the need for proper error handling and validation.

## Related Functions

- `sha512/256`: Computes the SHA-512/256 hash of the input.
- `keccak256`: Computes the KECCAK-256 hash of the input.

## Conclusion

The `sha256` function is a fundamental tool for computing SHA-256 hashes in Clarity smart contracts. It allows you to implement cryptographic operations, ensuring data integrity and simplifying cryptographic hashing. When used effectively, `sha256` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to handle cryptographic hashing operations.
