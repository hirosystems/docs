title: nft-burn?
description: Burn a non-fungible token (NFT) in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(nft-burn? asset-class asset-identifier sender)
```

- Input: `AssetName, A, principal`
- Output: `(response bool uint)`

## Why it matters

The `nft-burn?` function is crucial for:

1. Reducing the circulating supply of a non-fungible token (NFT).
2. Managing the lifecycle of NFTs by allowing their destruction.
3. Ensuring data integrity by removing ownership records of burned NFTs.
4. Simplifying the process of handling NFT burn operations in smart contracts.

## When to use it

Use `nft-burn?` when you need to:

- Reduce the circulating supply of an NFT.
- Manage the lifecycle of NFTs by allowing their destruction.
- Remove ownership records of burned NFTs.
- Handle NFT burn operations in your smart contract.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the `sender` principal owns the NFT before attempting to burn it.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other NFT functions for comprehensive NFT management.
- Handle the possible error cases to ensure robust contract behavior.

## Practical Example: Burning an NFT

Let's implement a function that burns an NFT owned by the sender:

```clarity
(define-non-fungible-token Stackaroo (string-ascii 40))

(define-public (burn-nft (id (string-ascii 40)))
  (nft-burn? Stackaroo id tx-sender)
)

;; Usage
(nft-mint? Stackaroo "Roo" tx-sender) ;; Returns (ok true)
(burn-nft "Roo") ;; Returns (ok true)
(nft-burn? Stackaroo "Roo" tx-sender) ;; Returns (err u3) because the asset no longer exists
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `nft-burn?` to burn an NFT owned by the sender.
2. Implementing a public function to handle the burn operation.
3. Handling both the successful burn and the case where the asset no longer exists.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `nft-burn?` without ensuring the `sender` owns the NFT, causing the operation to fail.
2. Assuming the NFT will always exist, leading to unhandled error cases.
3. Not handling all possible conditions, resulting in incomplete NFT management.
4. Overlooking the need for proper error handling and validation.

## Related Functions

- `nft-mint?`: Mints a new non-fungible token.
- `nft-transfer?`: Transfers ownership of a non-fungible token.
- `nft-get-owner?`: Retrieves the owner of a non-fungible token.

## Conclusion

The `nft-burn?` function is a fundamental tool for managing the lifecycle of non-fungible tokens in Clarity smart contracts. It allows you to reduce the circulating supply of NFTs, manage their destruction, and ensure data integrity. When used effectively, `nft-burn?` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to handle NFT burn operations.
