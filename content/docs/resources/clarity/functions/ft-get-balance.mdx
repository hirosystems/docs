title: ft-get-balance
description: Retrieve the balance of a fungible token for a principal in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(ft-get-balance token-name principal)
```

- Input: 
  - `token-name`: The name of the fungible token
  - `principal`: The principal whose balance to check
- Output: `uint`

## Why it matters

The `ft-get-balance` function is crucial for:

1. Querying the current balance of a fungible token for any principal.
2. Implementing balance checks before transfers or other token operations.
3. Providing transparency and visibility into token holdings.
4. Enabling other contracts or off-chain applications to verify token balances.

## When to use it

Use `ft-get-balance` when you need to:

- Check a user's token balance before performing operations.
- Implement balance-dependent logic in your contract.
- Provide balance information to users or other contracts.
- Verify sufficient funds for token transfers or burns.

## Best Practices

- Use `ft-get-balance` before attempting transfers to ensure sufficient balance.
- Consider caching balance results if queried frequently to optimize gas usage.
- Be aware that balances can change between checks and actual token operations.
- Use in combination with other ft-* functions for comprehensive token management.

## Practical Example: Balance Check Before Transfer

Let's implement a function that checks balance before transferring tokens:

```clarity
(define-fungible-token cBtc)

(define-public (transfer (amount uint) (recipient principal))
  (let
    (
      (senderBalance (ft-get-balance cBtc tx-sender))
    )
    (if (>= senderBalance amount)
      (ft-transfer? cBtc amount tx-sender recipient)
      (err u1)
    )
  )
)

;; Usage
(ft-mint? cBtc u100 tx-sender)
(transfer u50 'SPAXYA5XS51713FDTQ8H94EJ4V579CXMTRNBZKSF) ;; Returns (ok true)
(ft-get-balance cBtc tx-sender) ;; Returns u50
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `ft-get-balance` to check the sender's balance before attempting a transfer.
2. Implementing a conditional transfer based on the balance check.
3. Combining `ft-get-balance` with other ft-* functions for token management.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Assuming balances remain constant between checking and performing operations.
2. Not handling the case where a principal might not have any balance (returns 0).
3. Overusing `ft-get-balance` in loops, which can be inefficient for gas consumption.

## Related Functions

- `ft-transfer?`: Used to transfer tokens between principals.
- `ft-mint?`: Used to create new tokens, increasing the balance of a principal.
- `ft-burn?`: Used to destroy tokens, decreasing the balance of a principal.
- `ft-get-supply`: Used to get the current total supply of tokens.

## Conclusion

The `ft-get-balance` function is a fundamental tool for managing fungible tokens in Clarity smart contracts. It provides a straightforward way to query token balances, enabling you to implement robust token-based systems with proper balance checks and validations. When used effectively in combination with other token functions, this function ensures the integrity and accuracy of token operations within your smart contracts.
