title: bit-not
description: Use the bit-not function for bitwise complement operations in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(bit-not i1)
```

- Input: An integer (`int` or `uint`)
- Output: An integer of the same type as the input (`int` or `uint`)

## Why it matters

The `bit-not` function is crucial for:

1. Performing bitwise complement operations in smart contracts.
2. Implementing certain logical operations and algorithms.
3. Manipulating binary data at the bit level.
4. Creating bitmasks for various purposes.

## When to use it

Use the `bit-not` function when you need to:

- Invert all bits in an integer value.
- Create a bitmask for bitwise operations.
- Implement certain cryptographic or hashing algorithms.
- Perform low-level data manipulations.

## Best Practices

- Be aware of the differences between signed (`int`) and unsigned (`uint`) integers when using `bit-not`.
- Remember that `bit-not` on a `uint` will result in a large positive number due to two's complement representation.
- Use `bit-not` in combination with other bitwise operations (`bit-and`, `bit-or`, `bit-xor`) for complex bit manipulations.
- Consider the readability of your code when using bitwise operations extensively.

## Practical Example: Simple Flag System

Let's implement a simple flag system using `bit-not` and other bitwise operations:

```clarity
(define-constant FLAG_A u1)  ;; 0001
(define-constant FLAG_B u2)  ;; 0010
(define-constant FLAG_C u4)  ;; 0100
(define-constant FLAG_D u8)  ;; 1000

(define-data-var userFlags uint u0)

(define-public (toggle-flag (flag uint))
  (ok (var-set userFlags (bit-xor (var-get userFlags) flag)))
)

(define-public (clear-all-flags-except (flag uint))
  (ok (var-set userFlags (bit-and (var-get userFlags) flag)))
)

(define-public (set-all-flags-except (flag uint))
  (ok (var-set userFlags (bit-and (bit-not (var-get userFlags)) flag)))
)

(define-read-only (has-flag (flag uint))
  (is-eq flag (bit-and (var-get userFlags) flag))
)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `bit-not` in combination with `bit-and` to set all flags except a specific one.
2. Implementing a flag system using bitwise operations for efficient storage and manipulation.
3. Combining `bit-not` with other bitwise operations for complex flag manipulations.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting that `bit-not` on a `uint` results in a large positive number, not a negative number.
2. Overlooking the sign bit when using `bit-not` with signed integers.
3. Not considering the full range of bits when applying `bit-not` to smaller integer values.

## Related Functions

- `bit-and`: Used for bitwise AND operations.
- `bit-or`: Used for bitwise OR operations.
- `bit-xor`: Used for bitwise XOR operations.
- `bit-shift-left`: Used for left-shifting bits.
- `bit-shift-right`: Used for right-shifting bits.

## Conclusion

The `bit-not` function is a powerful tool for bitwise operations in Clarity smart contracts. When used in combination with other bitwise functions, this function enables efficient implementation of flags, bitmasks, and low-level data manipulations. However, you should be mindful of the differences between signed and unsigned integers and the potential for unexpected results when not used carefully.
