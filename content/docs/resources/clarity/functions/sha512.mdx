description: Compute the SHA-512 hash of a value in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(sha512 value)
```

- Input: `buff | uint | int`
- Output: `(buff 64)`

## Why it matters

The `sha512` function is crucial for:

1. Computing the SHA-512 hash of a given value.
2. Implementing cryptographic operations in smart contracts.
3. Ensuring data integrity by generating unique hashes.
4. Simplifying the process of handling cryptographic hashing in smart contracts.

## When to use it

Use `sha512` when you need to:

- Compute the SHA-512 hash of a given value.
- Implement cryptographic operations in your smart contract.
- Generate unique hashes to ensure data integrity.
- Handle cryptographic hashing operations.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the input value is correctly formatted and valid.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other cryptographic functions for comprehensive security management.
- Handle the possible error cases to ensure robust contract behavior.

## Practical Example: Computing a SHA-512 Hash

Let's implement a function that computes the SHA-512 hash of a given buffer:

```clarity
(define-read-only (compute-sha512 (input (buff 32)))
  (sha512 input)
)

;; Usage
(compute-sha512 0x68656c6c6f20776f726c64000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
;; Returns 0x638f0da7489fae1f981a47199a2854d0fa117cea82bd86049930aa86e565c6cdccd52fc0e6bba5a135961ed5b7360d5e2b0ff65889acbac01361f5e291a6da45
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `sha512` to compute the hash of a given buffer.
2. Implementing a public function to handle the hash computation.
3. Handling both successful and error cases.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `sha512` with incorrectly formatted or invalid input values, causing the operation to fail.
2. Assuming the hash will always be valid, leading to unhandled error cases.
3. Not handling all possible conditions, resulting in incomplete cryptographic hashing.
4. Overlooking the need for proper error handling and validation.

- `sha512/256`: Computes the SHA-512/256 hash of the input.
- `keccak256`: Computes the KECCAK-256 hash of the input.

## Conclusion

The `sha512` function is a fundamental tool for computing SHA-512 hashes in Clarity smart contracts. It allows you to implement cryptographic operations, ensuring data integrity and simplifying cryptographic hashing. When used effectively, `sha512` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to handle cryptographic hashing operations.
