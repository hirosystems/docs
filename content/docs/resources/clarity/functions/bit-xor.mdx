title: bit-xor
description: Use the bit-xor function for bitwise exclusive OR operations in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(bit-xor i1 i2...)
```

- Input: Two or more integers (`int` or `uint`)
- Output: An integer of the same type as the inputs (`int` or `uint`)

## Why it matters

The `bit-xor` function is crucial for:

1. Performing bitwise exclusive OR operations in smart contracts.
2. Implementing certain cryptographic algorithms and hash functions.
3. Creating toggle mechanisms for binary flags.
4. Detecting changes between two bit patterns.

## When to use it

Use the `bit-xor` function when you need to:

- Implement exclusive OR logic on binary data.
- Toggle specific bits in a value without affecting others.
- Compare two bit patterns to find differences.
- Create simple encryption or hashing mechanisms.

## Best Practices

- Ensure all input values are of the same type (either all `int` or all `uint`).
- Remember that `bit-xor` with 0 returns the original value, which can be useful for conditional operations.
- Use `bit-xor` in combination with other bitwise operations for complex bit manipulations.
- Consider the readability of your code when using bitwise operations extensively; add comments to explain the purpose.

## Practical Example: Simple Toggle Mechanism

Let's implement a simple toggle mechanism using `bit-xor`:

```clarity
(define-data-var flags uint u0)

(define-read-only (get-flag (flagPosition uint))
  (is-eq (bit-and (var-get flags) (bit-shift-left u1 flagPosition)) u0)
)

(define-public (toggle-flag (flagPosition uint))
  (begin
    (asserts! (< flagPosition u8) (err u1)) ;; Ensure flag position is valid
    (ok (var-set flags (bit-xor (var-get flags) (bit-shift-left u1 flagPosition))))
  )
)

;; Usage
(toggle-flag u2) ;; Toggles the 3rd bit (position 2)
(get-flag u2) ;; Returns false
(toggle-flag u2) ;; Toggles the 3rd bit again (position 2)
(get-flag u2) ;; Returns true
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `bit-xor` to toggle individual bits in a flags variable.
2. Combining `bit-xor` with other bitwise operations like `bit-and` and `bit-shift-left`.
3. Implementing a simple flag system using bitwise operations for efficient storage and manipulation.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Mixing signed (`int`) and unsigned (`uint`) integers in a single `bit-xor` operation.
2. Forgetting that `bit-xor` of a value with itself always results in 0.
3. Not considering the full range of bits when using `bit-xor` with smaller integer values.

## Related Functions

- `bit-and`: Used for bitwise AND operations.
- `bit-or`: Used for bitwise OR operations.
- `bit-not`: Used for bitwise NOT operations.
- `bit-shift-left`: Often used in combination with `bit-xor` for flag operations.
- `bit-shift-right`: Used for right-shifting bits.

## Conclusion

The `bit-xor` function is a powerful tool for bitwise operations in Clarity smart contracts. When used in combination with other bitwise functions, it enables efficient implementation of toggles, flags, and other bit-level data manipulations. To avoid unexpected results, be mindful of the types of integers used and the effects of the operation on the full range of bits.
