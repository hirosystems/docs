title: get
description: Retrieve a value from a tuple in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(get key-name tuple)
```

- Input: 
  - `key-name`: The name of the key in the tuple
  - `tuple`: The tuple to retrieve the value from
- Output: The value associated with the key in the tuple

## Why it matters

The `get` function is crucial for:

1. Accessing specific values within tuple data structures.
2. Extracting information from complex data types in contracts.
3. Enabling efficient data retrieval in contract logic.
4. Working with structured data returned by other functions or stored in variables.

## When to use it

Use `get` when you need to:

- Access a specific field in a tuple.
- Extract values from structured data returned by other functions.
- Work with complex data types in your contract logic.
- Implement data processing that involves tuple manipulation.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the key exists in the tuple to avoid runtime errors.
- Use meaningful key names for better code readability.
- Consider using `get` in combination with `optional` for safer data access.
- Be aware of the performance implications when working with large tuples.

## Practical Example: User Profile Management

Let's implement a simple user profile system using tuples and the `get` function:

```clarity
(define-map UserProfiles { userId: principal } { name: (string-ascii 50), age: uint })

(define-public (set-profile (name (string-ascii 50)) (age uint))
  (ok (map-set UserProfiles { userId: tx-sender } { name: name, age: age }))
)

(define-read-only (get-profile-name (user principal))
  (match (map-get? UserProfiles { userId: user }) profile
    (ok (get name profile))
    (err u404)
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-profile-age (user principal))
  (match (map-get? UserProfiles { userId: user }) profile
    (ok (get age profile))
    (err u404)
  )
)

;; Usage
(set-profile "Alice" u30)
(get-profile-name tx-sender) ;; Returns (ok "Alice")
(get-profile-age tx-sender) ;; Returns (ok u30)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `get` to retrieve specific fields from a tuple stored in a map.
2. Implementing getter functions that use `get` to access tuple data.
3. Handling cases where the profile might not exist.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Attempting to `get` a key that doesn't exist in the tuple, causing a runtime error.
2. Forgetting that `get` is case-sensitive for key names.
3. Not considering the performance impact of frequently accessing large tuples.

## Related Functions

- `merge`: Used to combine tuples, potentially creating new fields to `get`.
- `tuple`: Used to create tuples that can be accessed with `get`.
- `map-get?`: Often used in combination with `get` to retrieve data from maps.

## Conclusion

The `get` function is a fundamental tool for working with tuples in Clarity smart contracts. It provides a straightforward way to access structured data, enabling developers to work with complex data types efficiently. When used effectively, `get` enhances the contract's ability to manage and process structured information, leading to more organized and maintainable smart contract code.
