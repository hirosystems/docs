description: Compare values for equality in Clarity smart contracts.

## Function Signature

```clarity
(is-eq v1 v2 ...)
```




- Input: `A, A, ...`
- Output: `bool`

## Why it matters

The `is-eq` function is crucial for:

1. Comparing values to check for equality.
2. Implementing conditional logic based on value comparisons.
3. Ensuring data integrity by verifying that values match expected results.
4. Simplifying equality checks in smart contract code.

## When to use it

Use `is-eq` when you need to:

- Compare multiple values for equality.
- Implement logic that depends on whether values are equal.
- Verify that input values match expected constants or variables.
- Simplify equality checks in your contract.

## Best Practices

- Ensure all values being compared are of the same type to avoid type errors.
- Use `is-eq` for simple equality checks and combine with other logical functions for complex conditions.
- Be aware that `is-eq` does not short-circuit; all values are evaluated.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.

## Practical Example: Checking User Role

Let's implement a function that checks if a user has a specific role:

```clarity
(define-constant ADMIN_ROLE "admin")
(define-map UserRoles { userId: principal } { role: (string-ascii 10) })

(define-read-only (is-admin (user principal))
  (let
    (
      (userRole (default-to "none" (map-get? UserRoles { userId: user })))
    )
    (is-eq userRole ADMIN_ROLE)
  )
)

;; Usage
(map-set UserRoles { userId: tx-sender } { role: "admin" })
(is-admin tx-sender) ;; Returns true
```




This example demonstrates:
1. Using `is-eq` to compare a user's role with the constant `ADMIN_ROLE`.
2. Handling the case where the user role is not set by providing a default value.
3. Implementing a read-only function to check if a user is an admin.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Comparing values of different types, leading to type errors.
2. Assuming `is-eq` short-circuits like `and` or `or` (it does not).
3. Using `is-eq` for complex conditions where other logical functions might be more appropriate.
4. Not handling cases where values might be `none` or unset.

## Related Functions

- `is-some`: Checks if an optional value is `some`.
- `is-none`: Checks if an optional value is `none`.
- `asserts!`: Asserts a condition and throws an error if it is false.

## Conclusion

The `is-eq` function is a fundamental tool for comparing values in Clarity smart contracts. It provides a straightforward way to check for equality, enabling you to implement conditional logic and verify data integrity. When used effectively, `is-eq` simplifies equality checks and enhances the readability and maintainability of your smart contract code.
