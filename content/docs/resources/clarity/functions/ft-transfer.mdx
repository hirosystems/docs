title: ft-transfer?
description: Transfer fungible tokens between principals in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(ft-transfer? token-name amount sender recipient)
```

- Input: 
  - `token-name`: The name of the fungible token
  - `amount`: The amount of tokens to transfer (uint)
  - `sender`: The principal sending the tokens
  - `recipient`: The principal receiving the tokens
- Output: `(response bool uint)`

## Why it matters

The `ft-transfer?` function is crucial for:

1. Moving fungible tokens between different principals within a smart contract.
2. Implementing token transfer functionality in decentralized applications.
3. Enabling token-based transactions and interactions between users or contracts.
4. Facilitating token economy mechanisms within smart contracts.

## When to use it

Use `ft-transfer?` when you need to:

- Transfer tokens from one account to another.
- Implement payment or reward systems using custom tokens.
- Allow users to send tokens to each other within your dApp.
- Move tokens as part of more complex contract operations.

## Best Practices

- Always check the return value to ensure the transfer was successful.
- Implement proper access controls to prevent unauthorized transfers.
- Consider using `asserts!` or `try!` to handle transfer failures gracefully.
- Be aware that any principal can call this function, so add necessary guards.
- Verify sender has sufficient balance before attempting a transfer.

## Practical Example: Token Transfer Function

Let's implement a public function for transferring tokens with some basic checks:

```clarity
(define-fungible-token cBtc)

(define-public (transfer-tokens (amount uint) (recipient principal))
  (let
    (
      (sender tx-sender)
    )
    (asserts! (not (is-eq sender recipient)) (err u2))
    (asserts! (> amount u0) (err u3))
    (match (ft-transfer? cBtc amount sender recipient)
      success (ok success)
      error (err error)
    )
  )
)

;; Usage
(ft-mint? cBtc u100 tx-sender)
(transfer-tokens u50 'SPAXYA5XS51713FDTQ8H94EJ4V579CXMTRNBZKSF) ;; Returns (ok true)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `ft-transfer?` within a public function to transfer tokens.
2. Implementing basic checks for valid transfer conditions.
3. Handling the response from `ft-transfer?` and propagating it to the caller.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Forgetting that `ft-transfer?` can be called by any principal, potentially leading to unauthorized transfers.
2. Not handling all possible error cases returned by `ft-transfer?`.
3. Attempting to transfer more tokens than the sender's balance.
4. Using `ft-transfer?` with a token name that hasn't been defined in the contract.

## Related Functions

- `ft-mint?`: Used to create new tokens and assign them to a principal.
- `ft-burn?`: Used to destroy tokens, reducing the balance of a principal.
- `ft-get-balance`: Used to check the token balance of a principal.
- `ft-get-supply`: Used to get the current total supply of tokens.

## Conclusion

The `ft-transfer?` function is a fundamental component for implementing token transfers in Clarity smart contracts. It provides a straightforward way to move tokens between principals, enabling a wide range of token-based functionalities. When used with proper checks and balances, this function allows for the creation of secure and efficient token economies within decentralized applications on the Stacks blockchain.
