title: map-delete
description: Remove an entry from a map in Clarity smart contracts.
---

## Function Signature

```clarity
(map-delete map-name key-tuple)
```

- Input: `MapName, tuple`
- Output: `bool`

## Why it matters

The `map-delete` function is crucial for:

1. Removing entries from a map.
2. Managing and updating the state of data stored in maps.
3. Ensuring data integrity by allowing the deletion of obsolete or incorrect entries.
4. Simplifying the process of maintaining clean and accurate data in smart contracts.

## When to use it

Use `map-delete` when you need to:

- Remove an entry from a map.
- Manage and update the state of data stored in maps.
- Ensure data integrity by deleting obsolete or incorrect entries.
- Maintain clean and accurate data in your smart contract.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the key-tuple accurately identifies the entry to be deleted.
- Use meaningful variable names for better readability.
- Combine with other map functions for comprehensive map management.
- Be aware of the performance implications of frequent deletions in large maps.

## Practical Example: Deleting a User's Data

Let's implement a function that deletes a user's data from a map:

```clarity
(define-map UserData { userId: principal } { data: (buff 32) })

(define-public (delete-user-data (user principal))
  (ok (map-delete UserData { userId: user }))
)

;; Usage
(map-set UserData { userId: tx-sender } { data: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef }) ;; Returns true
(delete-user-data tx-sender) ;; Returns (ok true)
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `map-delete` to remove a user's data from the `UserData` map.
2. Implementing a public function to delete the data.
3. Handling the case where the user's data is present and needs to be removed.

## Common Pitfalls

1. Using `map-delete` with an incorrect key-tuple, causing the deletion to fail.
2. Assuming the entry will always exist, leading to unhandled cases.
3. Not handling all possible conditions, resulting in incomplete data management.
4. Overlooking the need for proper error handling and validation.

## Related Functions

- `map-set`: Sets the value associated with a key in a map.
- `map-get?`: Retrieves an entry from a map.
- `map-insert`: Inserts a value into a map if the key does not already exist.

## Conclusion

The `map-delete` function is a fundamental tool for managing data in Clarity smart contracts. It allows you to remove entries from maps, ensuring data integrity and maintaining clean and accurate data. When used effectively, `map-delete` enhances the reliability and maintainability of your smart contract code by providing a clear and concise way to manage map entries.
