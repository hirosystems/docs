title: Build an FT post-condition
description: Create post-conditions for fungible token transfers to ensure exact amounts are transferred as expected
---

```typescript
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

// Create a post-condition for fungible token transfers
const postCondition = Pc.principal("ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM")
  .willSendGte(500) // Amount in token's smallest unit
  .ft("ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE.token-ft", "my-token");

// Use in transaction options
const txOptions = {
  // ... other transaction options
  postConditions: [postCondition],
  postConditionMode: PostConditionMode.Deny,
};
```

## Use cases

- Securing fungible token transfers with amount validation
- Protecting users from unexpected token transfers in DeFi protocols
- Ensuring token swaps happen with expected amounts

## Key concepts

The `Pc` builder for fungible tokens accepts:

- `.ft()` - Takes two parameters:
  - Contract address with asset name (e.g., `"contract.asset-name"`)
  - Token name as defined in the contract
