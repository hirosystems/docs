title: Helper function to restrict contract calls
description: Implement access control to ensure functions can only be called by users, not other contracts
---

```clarity
;; Check if caller is a standard principal (user wallet)
(define-private (is-standard-principal-call)
  (is-none (get name (unwrap! (principal-destruct? contract-caller) false)))
)

;; Public function restricted to direct user calls
(define-public (user-only-function (amount uint))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-standard-principal-call) (err u401))
    ;; Function logic here
    (ok true)
  )
)
```

## Use cases

- Preventing contract-to-contract reentrancy attacks
- Ensuring human-initiated transactions for governance
- Restricting token minting to direct user actions
- Protecting admin functions from automated calls

## Key concepts

Principal types in Clarity:

- **Standard principals**: User wallets (SP/ST addresses)
- **Contract principals**: Deployed contracts (address.contract-name)
- **contract-caller**: The immediate caller of the current function
- **tx-sender**: The original transaction initiator
