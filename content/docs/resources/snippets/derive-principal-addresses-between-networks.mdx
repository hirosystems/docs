title: Derive principal addresses between networks
description: Convert addresses between mainnet and testnet by extracting and reconstructing with different version bytes
---

```clarity
;; Extract hash bytes from an address
(define-read-only (get-address-hash-bytes (address principal))
  (get hash-bytes (unwrap-panic (principal-destruct? address)))
)

;; Convert testnet address to mainnet
(define-read-only (testnet-to-mainnet (testnet-address principal))
  (let (
    ;; Extract the hash bytes from testnet address
    (hash-bytes (get-address-hash-bytes testnet-address))
    ;; Mainnet version byte
    (mainnet-version 0x16)
  )
    ;; Reconstruct with mainnet version
    (principal-construct? mainnet-version hash-bytes)
  )
)

;; Convert mainnet address to testnet
(define-read-only (mainnet-to-testnet (mainnet-address principal))
  (let (
    ;; Extract the hash bytes from mainnet address
    (hash-bytes (get-address-hash-bytes mainnet-address))
    ;; Testnet version byte
    (testnet-version 0x1a)
  )
    ;; Reconstruct with testnet version
    (principal-construct? testnet-version hash-bytes)
  )
)

;; Example usage
(testnet-to-mainnet 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM)
;; Returns: (ok SP1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRCBGD7R)
```

## Use cases

- Cross-network address verification
- Building multi-network dApps
- Address validation tools
- Network migration utilities

## Key concepts

Stacks addresses consist of:

- **Version byte**: Indicates network and address type
- **Hash bytes**: 20-byte hash of the public key
- **Checksum**: Built into the c32 encoding

### Version bytes reference

| Version | Network | Type | Prefix |
|---------|---------|------|--------|
| 0x16 | Mainnet | Standard | SP |
| 0x17 | Mainnet | Contract | SM |
| 0x1a | Testnet | Standard | ST |
| 0x1b | Testnet | Contract | SN |
