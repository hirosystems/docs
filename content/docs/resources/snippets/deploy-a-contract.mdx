title: Deploy a contract
description: Deploy a Clarity smart contract to the Stacks blockchain using Stacks.js

```typescript
import { STACKS_TESTNET } from "@stacks/network";
import { 
  makeContractDeploy, 
  broadcastTransaction,
  AnchorMode,
  PostConditionMode 
} from "@stacks/transactions";

const contractCode = `
(define-data-var counter uint u0)

(define-public (increment)
  (ok (var-set counter (+ (var-get counter) u1))))

(define-read-only (get-counter)
  (ok (var-get counter)))
`;

const txOptions = {
  contractName: "my-counter",
  codeBody: contractCode,
  senderKey: "753b7cc01a1a2e86221266a154af739463fce51219d97e4f856cd7200c3bd2a601",
  network: STACKS_TESTNET,
  anchorMode: AnchorMode.Any,
  postConditionMode: PostConditionMode.Allow,
  fee: 100000n, // Set an appropriate fee
};

const transaction = await makeContractDeploy(txOptions);
const broadcastResponse = await broadcastTransaction({ transaction });
console.log("Contract deployed!");
console.log("Transaction ID:", broadcastResponse.txid);
```

## Use cases

- Deploying new smart contracts to mainnet or testnet
- Automating contract deployments in CI/CD pipelines
- Programmatic contract deployment for dApp initialization
- Deploying contract upgrades or new versions

## Key concepts

Contract deployment requires:

- **Contract name**: Unique identifier for your contract (letters, numbers, hyphens)
- **Code body**: The Clarity contract code as a string
- **Sender key**: Private key of the account deploying the contract
- **Network**: Target network (mainnet, testnet, or devnet)
