title: Integrate API keys using Stacks.js
description: Configure Stacks.js to use API keys for enhanced rate limits and monitoring
---

```typescript
import { createApiKeyMiddleware, createFetchFn } from "@stacks/common";
import { StacksMainnet, StacksTestnet } from "@stacks/network";

// Create middleware with your API key
const apiMiddleware = createApiKeyMiddleware({
  apiKey: process.env.HIRO_API_KEY
});

// Create custom fetch function
const customFetch = createFetchFn(apiMiddleware);

// Configure network with API key
const network = new StacksMainnet({
  fetchFn: customFetch
});
```

## Use cases

- Increased API rate limits for production applications
- API usage monitoring and analytics
- Priority access during high traffic periods
- Custom enterprise support features

## Key concepts

API key benefits:

- **Higher rate limits**: 500 requests/minute vs 50 for anonymous
- **Usage tracking**: Monitor your API consumption
- **Priority queue**: Better performance during peak times
- **Support**: Access to dedicated support channels
