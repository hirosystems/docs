title: Create SHA256 hash in Clarity
description: Generate SHA-256 hashes from buffer data in Clarity smart contracts
---

```clarity
(define-read-only (create-sha256-hash (data (buff 4096)))
  (sha256 (unwrap-panic (to-consensus-buff? data)))
)

;; Example usage
(define-read-only (hash-message (message (string-utf8 200)))
  (create-sha256-hash (unwrap-panic (to-consensus-buff? message)))
)

;; Hash a simple string
(print (hash-message u"Hello World"))
```

## Use cases

- Creating unique identifiers from data
- Verifying data integrity in contracts
- Implementing commit-reveal schemes
- Building merkle trees for proofs

## Key concepts

The SHA-256 implementation in Clarity:

- Takes a buffer as input (max 1MB)
- Returns a 32-byte buffer hash
- Uses `to-consensus-buff?` to ensure consistent encoding
- Produces the same hash as off-chain implementations
