Running a Stacks node is crucial for developers aiming to interact directly with the Stacks blockchain. It allows for the verification of transactions, ensures decentralized operations, and enhances blockchain security.

- Clone the Stacks blockchain Docker repository
- Start the service
- Monitor the node's synchronization process

## Clone the Stacks blockchain Docker repository

Clone the Stacks blockchain Docker repository from GitHub:

```terminal
$ git clone git@github.com:hirosystems/stacks-blockchain-docker.git
$ cd stacks-blockchain-docker
```

## Start the service

Inside of the `stacks-blockchain-docker` directory, run the following command to start the Stacks node:

```terminal
$ chmod +x manage.sh
$ ./manage.sh -n <network> -a start
```

The `<network>` placeholder used below can be replaced with one of:

- `mainnet`
- `testnet`
- `mocknet`

## Monitor the node's synchronization process

To follow the logs for the Stacks node, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./manage.sh -n <network> -a logs
```

For networks other than `mocknet`, downloading the initial headers can take several minutes. Until the headers are downloaded, the `/v2/info` endpoints won't return any data.
