## API rate limits

The following rate-limits (in requests per minute, or RPM) are applicable for [all Hiro APIs](https://www.hiro.so/blog/updated-rate-limits-for-hiro-apis):

| API key | Rate Limit                        |
|:--------|:----------------------------------|
| No      | 50 requests per minute (RPM) per client IP, for unauthenticated traffic |
| Yes     | 500 requests per minute (RPM), regardless of origin IP, with an authenticated API key |

Rate limits are split between two service types:
- **Stacks services**: [Stacks Blockchain API](/apis/stacks-blockchain-api) and [Token Metadata API](/apis/token-metadata-api)
- **Bitcoin services**: [Ordinals API](/apis/ordinals-api) and [Runes API](/apis/runes-api)

Each service type has its own independent quota, allowing you to use both Stacks and Bitcoin APIs without one affecting the other's rate limits. For more details, see our guide on [response headers](/resources/guides/response-headers).
