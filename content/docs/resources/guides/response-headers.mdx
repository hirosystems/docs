title: Response headers
description: Understanding rate limit and quota information in API response headers.
---

All Hiro APIs return response headers that provide important information about rate limits and usage quotas. These headers are separated by service type (Stacks vs Bitcoin) to provide more granular control over API usage.

The following headers are returned with every API response:

```terminal
$ curl -I https://api.hiro.so/extended/v1/info -H 'x-api-key: your-api-key'
```

| Header | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `ratelimit-limit` | The rate limit ceiling for that endpoint |
| `ratelimit-remaining` | The number of requests left for the current window |
| `ratelimit-reset` | The time when the rate limit window resets (Unix timestamp) |
| `retry-after` | Time to wait before retrying (only present when rate limited) |

## Service-specific headers

Hiro APIs include additional headers that provide granular rate limit information per service type, reflecting the separation of rate limits between Stacks and Bitcoin services.

### Stacks service headers

When calling Stacks-related endpoints (Stacks Blockchain API, Token Metadata API, etc), you'll receive:

```typescript -c
// Example: Fetching Stacks account info
const response = await fetch('https://api.hiro.so/extended/v1/address/SP318Q55DEKHRXJK696033DQN5C54D9K2EE6DHRWP/assets', {
  headers: { 'x-api-key': apiKey }
});

console.log(response)

// New headers in response:
// x-ratelimit-cost-stacks: 1 // !mark
// x-ratelimit-limit-stacks-minute: 500
// x-ratelimit-remaining-stacks-minute: 499
```

| Header | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `x-ratelimit-cost-stacks` | The quota cost for this specific request |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-stacks-second` | Per-second limit for Stacks services |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-stacks-second` | Remaining requests this second |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-stacks-minute` | Per-minute limit for Stacks services |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-stacks-minute` | Remaining requests this minute |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-stacks-month` | Monthly limit for Stacks services |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-stacks-month` | Remaining requests this month |

### Bitcoin service headers

When calling Bitcoin-related endpoints (Ordinals API, Runes API), you'll receive:

```typescript
// Example: Fetching inscription data
const response = await fetch('https://api.hiro.so/ordinals/v1/inscriptions', {
  headers: { 'x-api-key': apiKey }
});

console.log(response)

// New headers in response:
// x-ratelimit-cost-bitcoin: 1
// x-ratelimit-limit-bitcoin-minute: 500
// x-ratelimit-remaining-bitcoin-minute: 499
```

| Header | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `x-ratelimit-cost-bitcoin` | The quota cost for this specific request |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-bitcoin-second` | Per-second limit for Bitcoin services |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-bitcoin-second` | Remaining requests this second |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-bitcoin-minute` | Per-minute limit for Bitcoin services |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-bitcoin-minute` | Remaining requests this minute |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-bitcoin-month` | Monthly limit for Bitcoin services |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining-bitcoin-month` | Remaining requests this month |

## Migration timeline

To ensure a smooth transition, we're maintaining backward compatibility:

- **August 1, 2024**: New headers are introduced alongside existing headers
- **September 1, 2024**: Legacy headers will be deprecated and removed

### Legacy headers (deprecated)

The following headers will be removed on September 1st, 2024:

- `x-ratelimit-limit-second`
- `x-ratelimit-limit-minute`
- `x-ratelimit-limit-month`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-second`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-minute`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining-month`

## Service classification

APIs are classified into service types based on their URL path:

| Service Type | Path Pattern | Examples |
|:-------------|:-------------|:---------|
| Bitcoin | `/ordinals/*` | Ordinals API endpoints |
| Bitcoin | `/runes/*` | Runes API endpoints |
| Stacks | All other paths | Stacks Blockchain API, Token Metadata API, Signer Metrics API, Explorer, and other services |

:::callout
The `x-ratelimit-cost-*` header shows the exact quota cost for each request, which may vary based on the endpoint and parameters used. Platform services (Platform API, Devnet) have separate rate limiting.
=======
## API-specific quotas

Different APIs consume different amounts of quota based on the computational cost:

| API | Service Type | Typical Cost |
|:----|:-------------|:-------------|
| Stacks Blockchain API | Stacks | 1 per request |
| Token Metadata API | Stacks | 1 per request |
| Ordinals API | Bitcoin | 1 per request |
| Runes API | Bitcoin | 1 per request |

:::callout
The `x-ratelimit-cost-*` header shows the exact quota cost for each request, which may vary based on the endpoint and parameters used.
