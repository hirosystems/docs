title: Post-Conditions
---

In Stacks, transactions can have *post-conditions*.

These offer additional security to ensure a transaction was executed as expected.

More precisely, adding post-conditions to a transaction can ensure that:

- STX tokens were transferred from an address
- FTs/NFTs were transferred from an address

<Callout title="Info">
Post-conditions aren't perfect. They can't say anything about the end-state after a transaction. In other words, they can't guarantee the receipt of FTs/NFTs, since they only check for sending.
</Callout>

Here's an example of a post-condition using the `Pc` helper, where the `principal` must send 1000 uSTX, or else the transaction will abort:

```ts -n
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const tx = await makeContractCall({
  // ...
  postConditions: [
    Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6').willSendEq(1000).ustx(),
  ],
});
```

If you prefer to write the post-condition manually, you can do so using the following approach:

```ts -n
import { StxPostCondition, FungiblePostCondition, NonFungiblePostCondition } from '@stacks/transactions';
// STX post-condition
const stxPostCondition: StxPostCondition = {
  type: 'stx-postcondition',
  address: 'SP2JXKMSH007NPYAQHKJPQMAQYAD90NQGTVJVQ02B',
  condition: 'gte', // 'eq' | 'gt' | 'gte' | 'lt' | 'lte'
  amount: '100',
};

// Fungible token post-condition
const ftPostCondition: FungiblePostCondition = {
  type: 'ft-postcondition',
  address: 'SP2JXKMSH007NPYAQHKJPQMAQYAD90NQGTVJVQ02B',
  condition: 'eq', // 'eq' | 'gt' | 'gte' | 'lt' | 'lte'
  amount: '100',
  asset: 'SP3D6PV2ACBPEKYJTCMH7HEN02KP87QSP8KTEH335.my-ft-token::my-token',
};

// Non-fungible token post-condition
const nftPostCondition: NonFungiblePostCondition = {
  type: 'nft-postcondition',
  address: 'SP2JXKMSH007NPYAQHKJPQMAQYAD90NQGTVJVQ02B',
  condition: 'sent', // 'sent' | 'not-sent'
  asset: 'SP3D6PV2ACBPEKYJTCMH7HEN02KP87QSP8KTEH335.my-nft::my-asset',
  assetId: Cl.uint(602),
};
```

## Post-condition mode

In addition to the post-condition itself, we can also specify a `mode` for the transaction to verify asset transfers.
The mode can be either `Allow` or `Deny`.

- `Allow` means that the transaction can transfer any asset (assuming no conflicting post-conditions).
- `Deny` means the transaction will fail if any asset transfers (not specified in the post-conditions) are attempted.

<Callout>
In either case, all post-conditions will still be checked.
By default, transactions are set to `Deny` mode for additional security.
