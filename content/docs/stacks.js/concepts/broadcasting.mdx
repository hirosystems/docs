## Broadcasting Transactions

A finalized transaction can be broadcasted to the network or serialized (to a byte representation) using Stacks.js.

```ts -n
import { broadcastTransaction, makeSTXTokenTransfer } from "@stacks/transactions";

const transaction = await makeSTXTokenTransfer({
  recipient: "ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5",
  amount: 42000000,
  senderKey:
    "753b7cc01a1a2e86221266a154af739463fce51219d97e4f856cd7200c3bd2a601",
  network: "devnet",
});

const tx = await broadcastTransaction({ transaction });

```
