## Installation

```package-install
sbtc
```

## Architecture

The sBTC protocol operates across multiple layers:

- **Bitcoin**: The original funds are sourced from Bitcoin. A depositor sends these funds to a group of signers, which manage a (rotating) multisignature address formatted for sBTC transactions.

- **sBTC API (Emily)**: This API is responsible for tracking deposits and notifying the signers about pending deposits.

- **Stacks**: The network where sBTC is minted. Once the deposit is confirmed, the signers mint the corresponding amount of sBTC to the depositor's specified address on the Stacks network.

## Deposit Flow

- **Create Deposit (Bitcoin) Transaction**:
  - Structure a Bitcoin transaction to send funds to the group of signers.
  - Use a specialized format that includes:
    - Deposit Script: Identifies which Stacks address the sBTC will be minted to and what the maximum fee (in satoshis) the signers may take in exchange for minting.
    - Reclaim Script: Allows the sender to reclaim their funds if the transaction is not processed by the signers.

- **Sign and Broadcast the Transaction**:
  - Sign the transaction with the sender's private key.
  - Broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network (Bitcoin Regtest for Stacks Testnet).

- **Notify the sBTC API (Emily)**:
  - Inform the API about the transaction by submitting its details. This step ensures that the signers are aware of the deposit and can track it.

- **Processing by Signers**: (no action required)
  - The signers retrieve and verify the deposit transaction from the Bitcoin blockchain.
  - Once verified, the signers mint the equivalent amount of sBTC on the Stacks network.

- **Receive sBTC (Stacks)**: (no action required)
  - The minted sBTC is sent to the depositor's designated Stacks address, completing the deposit process.
  - sBTC is SIP-010 compatible and will show up in Stacks wallets and explorers.

## sBTC Package Functions

The sBTC package exports high-level functions for building addresses and transactions for deposits.

### Examples

  
#### buildSbtcDepositAddress
Build a deposit address and metadata using `buildSbtcDepositAddress` with a wallet provider using `sendTransfer`.

```ts
import { buildSbtcDepositAddress, SbtcApiClientTestnet } from 'sbtc';

const client = new SbtcApiClientTestnet();

// 1. BUILD THE DEPOSIT ADDRESS AND METADATA
const deposit = buildSbtcDepositAddress({
  stacksAddress: TARGET_STX_ADDRESS,
  signersPublicKey: await client.fetchSignersPublicKey(),

  // OPTIONAL DEFAULTS
  // maxSignerFee: 80_000, // optional: fee to pay for the deposit transaction (taken from the signers from the sats)
  // reclaimLockTime: 6_000, // optional: lock time for the reclaim script
  // network: REGTEST, // optional: which bitcoin network to use
});

// `deposit.address` is the deposit address (send funds here, aka the deposit address as an output)

// 2. DEPOSIT USING YOUR FAVORITE WALLET (TYPICALLY ALSO BROADCASTED BY THE WALLET)
const txid = await WalletProvider.sendTransfer({
  recipient: deposit.address,
  amount: 100_000, // the amount to deposit; <=maxSignerFee is taken from this amount
});

// 3. NOTIFY THE SIGNERS
await client.notifySbtc({ txid, ...deposit });
```

#### buildSbtcDepositTx
The `buildSbtcDepositTx` function is similar to `buildSbtcDepositAddress`, but instead of returning just a deposit address, it constructs a complete Bitcoin transaction for depositing sBTC.

```ts
import { buildSbtcDepositTx } from 'sbtc';

// 1. BUILD THE DEPOSIT TRANSACTION AND METADATA
const deposit = buildSbtcDepositTx({
  amountSats: DEPOSIT_AMOUNT, // the amount in sats/sBTC to deposit; <=maxSignerFee is taken from this amount

  // same options as `buildSbtcDepositAddress`
  network,
  stacksAddress,
  signersPublicKey,
  maxSignerFee,
  reclaimLockTime,
});

// `deposit.transaction` has one output, which is the combined taproot of the deposit and reclaim scripts

// 2. SIGN THE TRANSACTION
deposit.transaction.sign(YOUR_BTC_PRIVATE_KEY);
deposit.transaction.finalize();

// 2. OR SIGN VIA EXTERNAL WALLET
const psbtBytes = deposit.transaction.toPSBT();

// 3. BROADCAST THE TRANSACTION
const txid = await client.broadcastTx(deposit.transaction);

// 4. NOTIFY THE SIGNERS
await client.notifySbtc(deposit);
```


#### sbtcDepositHelper
Create a fully-formed deposit transaction (assuming an address with spendable bitcoin UTXOs)

<Callout>Use this helper function if you are not using a wallet provider</Callout>

```ts
import { sbtcDepositHelper, SbtcApiClientTestnet } from 'sbtc';

const client = new SbtcApiClientTestnet();

// 1. BUILD THE DEPOSIT TRANSACTION AND METADATA (GIVEN UTXOS FOR AN ADDRESS)
const deposit = await sbtcDepositHelper({
  stacksAddress: TARGET_STX_ADDRESS, // where to send/mint the sBTC
  amountSats: 5_000_000, // (maximum) amount of sBTC to deposit

  signersPublicKey: pub, // the aggregated public key of the signers

  feeRate: await client.fetchFeeRate('medium'),
  utxos: await client.fetchUtxos(YOUR_BTC_ADDRESS),

  bitcoinChangeAddress: YOUR_BTC_ADDRESS,
});

// 2. SIGN THE TRANSACTION
deposit.transaction.sign(YOUR_BTC_PRIVATE_KEY);
deposit.transaction.finalize();

// 2. OR SIGN VIA EXTERNAL WALLET
const psbtBytes = deposit.transaction.toPSBT();

// 3. BROADCAST TRANSACTION
const txid = await client.broadcastTx(deposit.transaction);
console.log('txid', txid);

// 4. NOTIFY THE SIGNERS
const res = await client.notifySbtc(deposit);
console.log('res', res.status, res.statusMessage);
```


## HTTP Clients

Additionally, there are two API helpers, which make it easier to get all the data needed to create the above transactions:

- **SbtcApiClientMainnet** — a client for communicating with the different pieces of the sBTC deployment
- **SbtcApiClientTestnet** — a client for communicating with the different pieces of the sBTC deployment on Testnet
- **SbtcApiClientDevenv** — a client for developing against a local deployment of sBTC

While the final adjustments are still being made in the pre-release phase, this package may change default URLs and contract addresses on every minor release.

| Version | Purpose | Functionality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1.x | Developer release (hackathon) | |
| 0.2.x | Regtest/Testnet release | Deposit only |
| 0.3.x | Mainnet pre-release | Deposit only |

### Examples

```ts
import { SbtcApiClientMainnet, SbtcApiClientTestnet, SbtcApiClientDevenv } from 'sbtc';

const client = new SbtcApiClientMainnet();
// const client = new SbtcApiClientTestnet();
// const client = new SbtcApiClientDevenv();

const pub = await client.fetchSignersPublicKey(); // fetches the aggregated public key of the signers
const address = await client.fetchSignersAddress(); // fetches the p2tr address of the aggregated public key of the signers

const feeRate = await client.fetchFeeRate('low'); // or 'medium', 'high'
const unspents = await client.fetchUtxos(BTC_ADDRESS);
const hex = await client.fetchTxHex(TXID);

await client.broadcastTx(DEPOSIT_BTC_TX); // broadcast a deposit BTC transaction
await client.notifySbtc(DEPOSIT_BTC_TX); // notify the sBTC API about the deposit (otherwise it won't be processed)

const sbtcBalance = await client.fetchSbtcBalance(STX_ADDRESS); // fetch the sBTC balance of an Stacks address
```
