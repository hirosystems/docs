Post-conditions in Stacks transactions provide an additional layer of security. They ensure that transactions execute as expected without requiring the user to know the underlying smart contract code.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. [Construct post-conditions](#constructing-post-conditions).
2. [Use post-conditions](#using-post-conditions).
3. [Set the post-condition mode](#setting-the-post-condition-mode).
4. [Usage examples](#usage-examples).

## Constructing post-conditions

In Stacks.js, post-conditions can be constructed using the Pc helpers. These are inspired by Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

Start with the `Pc.principal` initializer to specify the address of the principal that will be verified in the post-condition. Then auto-complete the rest of the post-condition.

## Using post-conditions

Post-conditions can be added to contract calls and FT/NFT transfers to ensure assets are transferred as specified.

For instance, the following post-condition ensures that the principal initiating the transaction must send exactly 1000 uSTX, or else the transaction will abort.

```ts -cn
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const postCondition = Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6')
  .willSendEq(1000)
  .ustx();
```

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="All transfer methods">
    STX/FT

    `.willSendEq(amount: number)` ensures that the amount to be sent is **exactly** the specified value.
    
    `.willSendGte(amount: number)` ensures that the amount to be sent is **greater than or equal** to the specified value.
    
    `.willSendGt(amount: number)` ensures that the amount to be sent is **greater than** the specified value.
    
    `.willSendLte(amount: number)` ensures that the amount to be sent is **less than or equal** to the specified value.
    
    `.willSendLt(amount: number)` ensures that the amount to be sent is **less than** the specified value.

    `.ustx()` to specify uSTX as the FT asset _(ends the builder)_

    `.ft(contract: string, tokenName: string)` to specify a specific FT asset _(ends the builder)_

    NFT

    `.willSendAsset()` ensures that an asset should **be sent**.
    
    `.willNotSendAsset()` to specify an asset should **not be sent**
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Setting the post-condition mode

When creating a transaction, the mode of the transaction can be set to `Allow` or `Deny` to specify whether unspecified asset transfers are permitted.

```ts -n
import { PostConditionMode } from '@stacks/transactions';

const tx = await makeContractCall({
  // ...
  postConditionMode: PostConditionMode.Allow,
  // OR
  postConditionMode: PostConditionMode.Deny,
  // ...
});
```

Essentially, the `postConditionMode` is what tells the Stacks node whether to require (`Deny`) or ignore (`Allow`) the post-conditions when evaluating the transaction.

## Usage examples

### Amount uSTX sent

Construct a post-condition for a certain amount of uSTX to be sent.

```ts -cn
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const postCondition = Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6')
  .willSendEq(1000)
  .ustx();
```

### Amount FT sent

Construct a post-condition for a certain amount of a specific FT to be sent.

```ts -cn
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const postCondition = Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6.token-ft')
  .willSendGte(500)
  .ft('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6.token-ft', 'token');
```

### Amount NFT sent / not sent

Construct a post-condition for sending / not-sending a specific NFT.

```ts -cn
import { Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const postCondition = Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6')
  .willNotSendAsset()
  .nft('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6.token-nft::token', Cl.uint(12));
```

### Amount SFT sent / not sent

Construct a post-condition for sending / not-sending a specific SFT (Semi-fungible token).

```ts -cn
import { Cl, Pc } from '@stacks/transactions';

const postConditionForNFT = Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6')
.willSendAsset()
.nft(
  "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.semi-fungible-token::semi-fungible-token-id",
  Cl.tuple({ "token-id": Cl.uint(1), owner: Cl.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6') })
);

const postConditionForFT = Pc.principal('STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6')
.willSendEq(500)
.ft("ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.semi-fungible-token", "semi-fungible-token");
```

<Callout title="Note">
The previous builders (`makeStandardSTXPostCondition`, `makeStandardFungiblePostCondition`, etc) were removed in `v7.0.0`.
