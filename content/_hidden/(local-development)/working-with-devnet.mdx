title: Working with devnet
description: Set up and use Clarinet's local development network for testing smart contracts
---

Clarinet's devnet gives you a complete local blockchain environment. You'll run Bitcoin and Stacks nodes, APIs, and explorers right on your machine using Docker containers.

This lets you test contracts, debug transactions, and develop frontends without spending real money or waiting for network confirmations.

## What you'll learn

You'll learn how to:
- [x] Start and configure a local devnet
- [x] Deploy contracts to your local network  
- [x] Use devnet accounts for testing
- [x] Monitor transactions and contract calls
- [x] Troubleshoot common devnet issues

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running
- A Clarinet project (see [Creating a Clarinet Project](/creating-a-clarinet-project))
- Basic familiarity with terminal commands

## Step 1: Start your devnet

Navigate to your Clarinet project directory and start the devnet:

```bash
clarinet devnet start
```

You'll see Docker containers spinning up. This creates a full blockchain stack:
- Bitcoin node (local bitcoind)
- Stacks node (local stacks-blockchain)  
- Stacks API (for querying blockchain data)
- Stacks Explorer (web interface)
- Bitcoin Explorer
- PostgreSQL database

The command opens an interactive dashboard by default. You can view logs instead with `--no-dashboard`.

## Step 2: Access your local blockchain

Once devnet starts, you can access these services:

- **Stacks Explorer**: http://localhost:8000 - View blocks, transactions, and contracts
- **Bitcoin Explorer**: http://localhost:8001 - Monitor Bitcoin transactions  
- **Stacks API**: http://localhost:3999 - Query blockchain data programmatically

Your contracts from `contracts/` are automatically deployed when devnet starts.

## Step 3: Use devnet accounts

Devnet provides pre-funded accounts for testing. You can find account details in:
- The devnet dashboard (default view)
- `settings/Devnet.toml` configuration file

Each account has:
- STX tokens for transaction fees
- Bitcoin for stacking/mining operations
- Private keys for signing transactions

## Step 4: Test contract interactions

With devnet running, you can interact with your contracts through:

**Clarinet console** (in a new terminal):
```bash
clarinet console
```

**Frontend applications** pointing to `http://localhost:3999`

**Direct API calls**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3999/v2/info
```

## Verify it's working

Check that devnet is running properly:

1. **Visit the explorer**: Go to http://localhost:8000 and verify you see recent blocks
2. **Check API health**: Run `curl http://localhost:3999/v2/info` and confirm you get network info
3. **View your contracts**: Look for your deployed contracts in the explorer's contract section

See recent transactions and your contract deployments? You're good to go.

## Deploy and try it out

Your contracts are automatically deployed when devnet starts. To test them:

1. **Use the console**: Run `clarinet console` and call contract functions
2. **Check deployment status**: View deployments in the explorer or dashboard
3. **Test with a frontend**: Point your dapp to the local API endpoint

## Troubleshooting

**Error: clarinet was unable to create network**
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Check that ports 3999, 8000, 8001 aren't in use by other applications

**Containers won't start**
- Stop any running devnet: `clarinet devnet stop`
- Clear Docker containers: `docker system prune`
- Restart devnet

**Contracts not deploying**
- Check `Clarinet.toml` for syntax errors
- Verify contract files are in the `contracts/` directory
- Review deployment logs in the dashboard

## Configuration options

Customize devnet behavior with these flags:

- `--manifest-path`: Use a different Clarinet.toml file
- `--deployment-plan-path`: Specify custom deployment plan
- `--no-dashboard`: Show logs instead of interactive dashboard  
- `--use-on-disk-deployment-plan`: Use existing deployment plan without updates

Modify `settings/Devnet.toml` to change:
- Network ports
- Docker images
- Mining configuration  
- Epoch settings
