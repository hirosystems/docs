Running a Stacks node is crucial for developers aiming to interact directly with the Stacks blockchain. It allows for the verification of transactions, ensures decentralized operations, and enhances blockchain security.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. [Clone the Stacks blockchain Docker repository](#clone-the-stacks-blockchain-docker-repository).
2. [Start the service](#start-the-service).
3. [Monitor the node's synchronization process](#monitor-the-nodes-synchronization-process).

## Clone the Stacks blockchain Docker repository

Clone the Stacks blockchain Docker repository from GitHub:

```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain-docker.git
$ cd stacks-blockchain-docker
```

## Start the service

Inside of the `stacks-blockchain-docker` directory, run the following command to start the Stacks node:

```terminal
$ ./manage.sh -n <network> -a start
```

The `<network>` placeholder used below can be replaced with one of:

- `mainnet`
- `testnet`
- `mocknet`

## Monitor the node's synchronization process

To follow the logs for the Stacks node, run the following command:

```terminal
$ ./manage.sh -n <network> -a logs
```

For networks other than `mocknet`, downloading the initial headers can take several minutes. Until the headers are downloaded, the `/v2/info` endpoints won't return any data.
