title: Hiro Documentation Site Landing Page Redesign
---

## Overview

One of the most important parts of the developer documentation experience is the initial landing page user interface and design. If a landing page is not well thought out or designed, developers may choose to look at other alternatives, especially if content is not easily "discoverable."

This page lays out some initial thinking about how Hiro and its design partners should approach redesigning the Hiro Docs site so improvements can be made on the overall design and features of the site in preparation for the "lightning strike" in March.

## Landing page

The first experience a developer or reader has with a documentation site is the initial landing page seen when navigating to a docs site (for example, *companyname.com/docs* or *docs.companyname.com*). When a user comes to this page, the expectation is that the site is easy to navigate, in addition to being able to quickly find information. This is the beginning of the "user journey;" a starting point for the time spent on the site. If the landing page is poorly designed, or information is not easily "discoverable," the user likely never begins the user journey, and thus, user engagement suffers.

To address these concerns, the Docs team has come up with some ideas, thoughts, and drawings that illustrate initial ideas and thoughts about what is needed for the new Hiro Docs site. Although somewhat rudimentary, these drawings define the team's approach to the redesign and what the new developer documentation experience should look like.

### Landing page + content page drawings

The drawings below show an initial design of what the [Hiro Docs](https://docs.hiro.so/) site landing page and content pages could look like with some design improvements.

## User journey and documentation flow

Once a user comes to the new and improved Hiro Docs site, the first task the user likely wants to perform is immediately locate information about Hiro and its products. Because the team chose a tile-based design, this should make it much easier for a user to quickly know where to go and what to select. The process should be similar to the following steps listed below.

1. The user navigates to the main [Hiro Docs](https://docs.hiro.so/) site, directing the user to the new landing page.
2. On the [landing page](https://docs.hiro.so/intro), the user clicks the desired tile in either the **Hiro Basics** or **Hiro Products** section.
3. Once a tile is selected, the user is directed to that specific Content page, which contains all relevant information for that product or piece of content. The left navigation should also be specific to that content (if possible).
4. Following the same tile-based approach, the user selects a tile for more information about a specific piece of content.
5. The "child" page for that content is displayed, enabling the user to view information related to the desired topic.
6. The user then reads the desired content on the page. At the bottom of the page, there is "previous page" and "next page" links where the user can continue on a pre-defined user journey.

### Example user flow (smart contracts)

The example below is taken directly from the drawings shown earlier.

1. The user enters the web address for the [Hiro Docs](https://docs.hiro.so) site and sees the landing page(https://docs.hiro.so/intro).
2. Wanting to learn more about smart contracts, the user selects the *Smart Contracts* tile in the **Hiro Basics** section of the landing page.
3. The user views the **Smart Contracts** product page, where information is presented on how to write, test, troubleshoot, integrate, and deploy a smart contract, again in tile format.
4. The user chooses the **Write a Contract** tile.
5. The **Add a Contract** page is then displayed with content describing how to add a new contract to your new project.
5. When finished, the user has several different options to continue. The user can:

- Click either the **Previous** (Create a Project) or **Next** (Check Contracts) links at the bottom of the page.
- Select a different page from the left navigation pane.
- Click Hiro Docs at the top left of the page to return to the landing page.
