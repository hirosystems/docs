title: Hiro Documentation Site Landing Page Redesign
---

## Overview

One of the most important parts of the developer documentation experience is the initial landing page user interface and design. If a landing page is not well thought out or designed, developers may choose to look at other alternatives, especially if content is not easily "discoverable."

This page lays out some initial thinking about how we should approach redesigning the Hiro Docs site so that we can improve the overall design and functionality of the site in preparation for the "lightning strike" in March.

## Landing Page

The first experience a developer or reader has with a documentation site is the initial landing page that they see when they come to a docs site (e.g. https://companyname.com/docs or http://docs.companyname.com). When a user comes to this page, the expectation will be that the site is easy to navigate, in addition to being able to quickly find information. This is the beginning of the "user journey;" a starting point for the time spent on the site. If the landing page is poorly designed, or information is not easily "discoverable," the user will likely not begin the user journey, and thus, user engagement suffers.

To address these concerns, the Docs team has come up with some mock-ups that illustrate our initial ideas and thoughts about what we want the new Hiro Docs site to look like. ALthough somewhat rudimentary, these drawings should help you understand our approach to the redesign and what we hope to have as a new developer documentation experience.

### Landing Page + Content Page Mock-Ups

The drawings below show an initial design of what the [Hiro Docs](https://docs.hiro.so/) site landing page and content pages could look like with some design improvements.

## User Journey and Documentation Flow

Once a user comes to the new and improved Hiro Docs site, the first task the user will want to perform is immediately locate the information they are looking for. Because we chose a tile-based design, this should make it much easier for a user to quickly know where to go and what to select. The process should be similar to the following steps listed below.

1. The user navigates to the main [Hiro Docs](https://docs.hiro.so/) site, directing the user to the new landing page.
2. On the [landing page](https://docs.hiro.so/intro), the user clicks on the desired tile in either the **Hiro Basics** or **Hiro Products** section.
3. Once a tile is selected, the user should then be directed to that specific Content page, which contains all relevant information for that product or piece of content. The left navigation should also be specific to that content (if possible).
4. Following the same tile-based approach, the user clicks on a tile for more information about the content they would like to access.
5. The "child" page for that content should be displayed, enabling the user to view information related to the desired topic.
6. The user can then read the desired content on the page. At the bottom of the page, there should be "previous page" and "next page" links so the user can continue on a pre-defined user journey.

### Example User Flow (Smart Contracts)

The example below is taken directly from the mock-ups show in the Landing Page + Content Page Mockups section on this page.

1. The user enters the web address for the [Hiro Docs](https://docs.hiro.so) site. The user sees the Landing Page(https://docs.hiro.so/intro).
2. Wanting to learn more about smart contracts, the user clicks on the *Smart Contracts* tile in the **Hiro Basics** section of the landing page.
3. The user sees the **Smart Contracts** product page, where information is presented on how to write, test, troubleshoot, integrate, and deploy a smart contract, again in tile format. The user chooses the **Write a Contract** tile.
4. The **Add a Contract** page is displayed with content describing how to add a new contract to your new project.
5. When the user is finished reading the content, the user has several different options to continue. The user can:

- click on either the **Previous** (Create a Project) or **Next** (Check Contracts) links at the bottom of the page.
- Select a different page from the left navigation pane.
- Click on Hiro Docs at the top left of the page to return to the landing page.
