# Clarinet

## What is the Clarinet
Clarinet is a Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool, designed to facilitate smart contract understanding, 
development, testing and deployment. Clarinet consists of a Clarity Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop (REPL) console, and a testing harness, 
which, when used together, enables you to rapidly develop and test a Clarity smart contract, with the need to deploy the contract to a local devnet or testnet.
