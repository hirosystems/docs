title: Deploying Gaia Hub on Amazon EC2
---

## Introduction

The template provided on this page provides an easy way to deploy a Gaia hub directly to Amazon EC2. You can use this
template to deploy your own Gaia hub to your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. Amazon EC2 is an affordable and
convenient cloud computing provider. The template provides a one-click deployment for Amazon EC2 with either S3 or EBS as a
storage provider.

## Prerequisites

This procedure uses Amazon CloudFormation to configure an EC2 cloud computing provider to run the Gaia hub service with
an S3 or EBS provider for file storage. You should have access to an AWS account either through your personal account or
through a corporate account. This account should have permissions to create resources.

Additionally, you must also own a domain name and be able to update the DNS records associated with that domain name.
The procedure on this page uses a free domain created on [freenom](https://www.freenom.com), generically the procedure used
is similar to other domain name providers.

## Launching the template

Use a link in the table to launch the CloudFormation template in the AWS region that you wish to deploy a Gaia hub.

| Template name            | Description                                                          | Launch                                                            |

## Task 1: Configure the CloudFormation template

Before launching your Gaia hub, you must configure the template with the appropriate values for your hub and the domain
it runs on.

1. Launch the template using the **Launch stack** button in the preceding table.
2. Review the **Prepare template** and **Template source** fields to ensure that the fields contain template values.

![CloudFormation specify template](/img/cloudformation-specify-template.png)

3. Click **Next**.
4. Specify configuration details for your Gaia hub:

   i. Enter the **Stack name**. This name must be lowercase and unique within your AWS account.

   ![CloudFormation stack name](/img/cloudformation-stack-name.png)

   ii. Enter the domain name on which the hub should run in the **DomainName** field. You must own this domain name and
   be able to update the DNS records associated with it.

   ![CloudFormation domain name](/img/cloudformation-domain-name.png)

   iii. Enter an email address associated with the Gaia hub in the **EmailAddress** field. This should be a valid email
   that you have access to.

   ![CloudFormation email](/img/cloudformation-email.png)

   iv. Enter the name of the S3 bucket to create for data storage in the **GaiaBucketName** field. The template combines
   this name with the stack name to create a unique S3 bucket. The template ignores this field if **GaiaStorageType** is
   set to `disk`.

   ![CloudFormation bucket name](/img/cloudformation-bucket.png)

   v. Select the **GaiaStorageType** of which to use as a backend for the Gaia Hub. Selecting `s3` causes the template
   to create an S3 bucket based on the name given in the previous step. Selecting `disk` causes the template to attach a
   separate EBS volume to the EC2 instance for Hub storage.

   ![CloudFormation storage type](/img/cloudformation-storage-type.png)

   vi. Select an available **InstanceType** from the drop-down. The default value is `t2.micro`.

   vii. In the **KeyName** drop-down, select an [EC2 KeyPair](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#KeyPairs:)
   to enable SSH access to the EC2 instance. You should download the `.pem` keyfile for this pair from the EC2 console.

   For more information see the [EC2 key pair documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#prepare-key-pair).

   ![CloudFormation key name](/img/cloudformation-keyname.png)

   viii. Leave the **SSHLocation** field with the default value of `0.0.0.0/0` to enable SSH access from any IP address.
   If you wish to restrict SSH access to the EC2 instance to a certain IP, you can update this field.

   ix. Select a _public_ subnet and its associated virtual private cloud (VPC) from the **SubnetId** and **VpcId** drop-downs to designate
   where to deploy the Gaia hub instance.

   ![CloudFormation subnet and VPC](/img/cloudformation-subnet.png)

5. Click **Next**.
6. Configure stack options for your Gaia hub:

   i. Enter any key-value pairs you wish to include as tags for your Gaia hub. These are optional and display-only, they
   have no effect on the behavior of the CloudFormation stack.

   ii. Select an IAM role for the Gaia hub. This is optional, if you don't specify am IAM role, the container runs
   with the same permissions as your AWS account.

7. Click **Next**.
8. Review the configuration of your Gaia hub, and make any changes necessary.
9. At the bottom of the page, select the checkbox to acknowledge that AWS may create IAM resources with custom names.

![CloudFormation IAM resources](/img/cloudformation-iam-resources.png)

10. Click **Create stack** to launch your Gaia hub. The AWS console displays the summary of the stack.

## Task 2: Retrieve the public IP of your Gaia hub

Your stack can take several minutes to launch. You can monitor the **Events** tab of your hub to review the current
progress of the launch. When the launch is complete, the **Outputs** tab displays information about the hub. Select
the **PublicIP** and copy it to configure your domain name.

![CloudFormation outputs](/img/cloudformation-details.png)

## Task 3: Configure a domain name

Connect your domain to the Gaia hub EC2 instance by creating an `A` record for the domain DNS entry, and enter the
public IP from the previous step. In general, this procedure is similar depending on your hostname provider.

If you are using a free domain from [freenom], use the following procedure:

1. Log in to your freenom account.
2. Under **Services** > **My Domains**, click **Manage Domain** next to the domain corresponding to your Gaia hub.

![My freenom domains](/img/freenom-my-domains.png)

3. Click **Manage Freenom DNS** in the tab bar.
4. In the **Add Records** table, select `A` from the **Type** drop-down, then paste the public IP of your Gaia hub EC2
   instance in the **Target** field.
5. Click **Save Changes** to update the DNS record.

:::note

It can take up to 15 minutes for your DNS record changes to propagate. In a terminal, use the command
`dig A +short <yourdomain.co>` to review if the changes have propagated. If the output of this command is the container
public IP, the changes were successful.

:::

## Accessing your Gaia hub with SSH

To SSH into your Gaia hub EC2 host directly, you must have the keyfile used in container creation. Access the host with
the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ssh -i <your keyfile.pem> admin@<public_ip_address>
```

## Making changes to your Gaia hub

If you want to make changes to your Gaia hub, there are two options. You can delete the entire CloudFormation stack
using the **Delete** button in the CloudFormation dashboard. Once you have deleted the stack, you can re-create one and
modify your DNS to point at the new public IP.

![CloudFormation delete](/img/cloudformation-delete.png)

To modify the instance in place, navigate to the [EC2 instances console][] and type the instance name into the
**Filter instances** field. Select the instance from the search suggestion, then click the instance to select it.

On the **Tags** tab, you can click **Manage tags** to update the relevant key value pairs for the instance. If you make
changes to these tags, click **Save**, then select **Reboot instance** from the **Instance state** drop-down. Changes to
the tags are only applied to the instance at reboot.
