## Overview

Hiro contnually makes changes and updates to add new features and functionality. Each month, these changes describe which products are affected, what changes and updates were made, and what actions need to be taken to ensure have these updates.these updates are applied.

The sections below describe the changes and updates made in November


## **Stacks API**

Stacks API had several updates and changes released to prepare for the upcoming Stacks 2.1 network upgrade. Specifically, the following updates were made:

- A new property,[`miner_address`](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-blockchain-api/pull/1413), was added to the `miner_rewards` event payload. This property identifies the principal that mined the block, while also storing that value so subsequent queries can use this property to find items like unique miners.

A key Stacks 2.1 feature is the option to choose alternative recipients for rewards, which enables you to track the `miner_rewards` event for alternative recipients via the `miner_address` field. This field encodes the miner address. 

**Note**This field replaces the `recipient` field with the generalized recipient, which is currently hard-coded to the miner. 

- A new parsing methodology was introduced for the new [PoX-2 print events](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-blockchain-api/pull/1403). This update adds account balance locked state validations tests to ensure Stacks API and `stacks-node` have matching balance and locked states after each of the various Stacking operations, and through each of the PoX transition periods. 

- The[aggregating query limit logic](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-blockchain-api/pull/1401) feature was added, which sets query limits based on the resource type being queried, which mostly determines which tables are queried. Categorizing queries in this way meant modifying some of the existing query limits for some endpoints. This should help reduce and avoid out of memory (OOM) errors in the future.

## **Blockchain**

An ecosystem milestone was reached with code complete on the Stacks 2.1 network upgrade.

For more detailed information about the Stacks 2.1 update, please see the [Developer’s Guide to Stacks 2.1](https://www.hiro.so/blog/a-developers-guide-to-stacks-2-1) blog post, and the blog post on [how the upgrade will impact stacking](https://www.hiro.so/blog/how-the-stacks-2-1-transition-impacts-stacking). 

## **Clarinet**

There were several updates and changes made to chainhooks, a feature that enables developers to add IFTTT logic across both the Bitcoin and Stacks blockchains to their applications. These updates included:

- The developer experience was modified by adding a [new mode](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/pull/657): `$ chainhook-node replay –testnet`,which enables you to replay devnet / testnet / mainnet dumps.

- The `chainhookd-node` experience was improved by adding presets. You may now use commands like: `$ chainhook-node start` – and identify devnet, testnet, or mainnet and have their local environments set up in just a few minutes. For more information about these commands, please see the [Using Chainhooks](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet/feature-guides/chainhooks?_gl=1*yvh6u7*_ga*NTQ3NDA3NTIuMTY2MDA3MTQ1MA..*_ga_NB2VBT0KY2*MTY3MzYzNTY4Mi43Mi4wLjE2NzM2MzU2ODIuMC4wLjA.#using-chainhooks)feature guide.

- To support the [Stacks 2.1 upgrade](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/pull/669), Clarinet was updated to improve error management in event observer, while adding support for new event types and clarity version in deployment plans.
