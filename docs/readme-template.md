title: README Template

## Overview

The current structure and format of the README pages in each Hiro repository differs significantly, depending on product, leading to a disjointed experience for our developer community. To ensure a consistent "look and feel" of README pages across all repositories, in addition to ensuring README files are not too long, this template should be used as a basic framework for creating and updating these pages. Ideally, each README page should be between 1-2 pages.

This template is not meant to be restrictive, however, if we have a similar format across all repositories, this should make the developer experience more seamless and easy to follow.

The sections below describe each heading and structure for this new README file format.

## Introduction**

*This section should include a **brief** description of the product or feature. This is not meant to be all-encompassing or exhaustive, but rather, a short introduction for the developer to understand the product at a high level.*

*When possible, include a link to the "Overview" section in the Hiro docs for the product.*

## Prerequisites

*This section should cover any steps or requirements that need to be meet before using the product or feature. This may include packages, libraries, or executables that need to be run/installed before setting up the local environment.*

## Setting up the local environment

*Povide a brief series of required steps for the user to get their local environment up and running. Whenever possible, include real-world code snippets and samples that users can copy and use.*

## Usage

*Briefly describe some of the tasks/actions a user can perform. Instead of desribing these in detail here, provide links to the Hiro technical documentation instead.*

## Additional Resources

*If there are some additional resources you would like to point the user to, provide links in this section.*
