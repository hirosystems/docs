The [Stacks Blockchain API](/get-started/stacks-blockchain-api) is an API that helps app developers to view and use the state of the Stacks blockchain.

In this tutorial you will extend [the To-dos app](/example-apps/to-dos) to share individual lists publicly using the Stacks blockchain.

The registry of shared to-dos lists is implemented by a Clarity smart contract named [`todo-registry`](https://github.com/friedger/blockstack-todos/blob/tut/public-registry/contracts/todo-registry.clar). Data from this contract will be shown in the to-dos app.

The final app will look like this:

![What you'll be creating in this tutorial](/img/todos-public-registry.png)

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

- Observed transactions while they are added to the blockchain
- Consumed APIs to show recent transactions, data map entries and read-only functions
- Experienced serializing and deserializing Clarity values

## Prerequisites

### Check testnet status

To make sure you're not running into any challenges related to our network, please open up the [Status Checker](https://stacks-status.com/)
and confirm that all systems are operational. If some systems seem to have issues, it is best to wait until they are back up before you proceed with the next steps.

Furthermore, the to-dos app will interact with a smart contract deployed as `ST1234....todo-registry`. The contract source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/friedger/blockstack-todos/blob/tut/step1/contracts/todo-registry.clar).

There may already be a deployed version available on the testnet; the [Explorer](https://explorer.stacks.co/) can be used to search for it.

Alternatively, the contract can be deployed as described in the [hello world tutorial](/tutorials/clarity-hello-world). Then you have to use the corresponding contract address and name in this tutorial. Throughout this tutorial, we use `ST3YPJ6BBCZCMH71TV8BK50YC6QJTWEGCNDFWEQ15.todo-registry` as an example.

### Tutorials

You should have followed the instructions of the to-dos app tutorial. You should have the code ready on your local machine. It is also helpful to have a basic understanding of Clarity as explained in the counter tutorial. If you are using mocknet or a new, empty testnet you can create transactions following the tutorial about signing transactions.

### Check your to-dos app

In your code repository of the to-dos app, launch the app by running the `start` command.

```
npm run start
```

In your browser, you should see the to-dos app.

## Registering a public URL

The Connect library (that is already used for authentication in the to-dos app) provides also methods to create, sign and broadcast transactions to the Stacks blockchain as explained in the signing transaction tutorial.

### Step 1: Define contract

The contract was already written and deployed to the blockchain. Its address and name is used often in the tutorial and therefore define some constants in the `constants.js` file by adding the following two lines:

```js
// src/assets/constants.jsx
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "ST3YPJ6BBCZCMH71TV8BK50YC6QJTWEGCNDFWEQ15";
export const CONTRACT_NAME = "todo-registry";
```

### Step 2: Create registration component

The user needs a UI component to conveniently create `register` transactions on the chain.
The contract function `register` takes two arguments:

```clarity
(define-public (register (name (buff 30)) (url (buff 255))) ...)
```

Create a new filed named `PublicUrlRegistrar.jsx` in the `src/components` folder and add the `PublicUrlRegistrar` component:

```js
// src/components/PublicUrlRegistrar.jsx
import React from "react";
import { Text } from "@blockstack/ui";
import { useConnect } from "@stacks/connect-react";
import { bufferCVFromString } from "@stacks/transactions";
import { CONTRACT_ADDRESS, CONTRACT_NAME } from "../assets/constants";

export const PublicUrlRegistrar = ({ userSession }) => {
  const { doContractCall } = useConnect();
  const { username } = userSession.loadUserData();
  const url = `${document.location.origin}/todos/${username}`;

  const register = () => {
    // do the contract call
    doContractCall({
      contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
      functionName: "register",
      functionArgs: [bufferCVFromString(username), bufferCVFromString(url)],
      onFinish: (data) => {
        console.log({ data });
      },
    });
  };
  return (
    <>
      <Text
        color="blue"
        cursor="pointer"
        fontSize={1}
        fontWeight="500"
        onClick={() => {
          // register the public URL
          register();
        }}
      >
        Register on-chain
      </Text>
    </>
  );
};
```

It is a simple button that calls `doContractCall` method of the Connect library when clicked. The method makes an api call to the Stacks authenticator. The authenticator creates a contract call transaction that is signed by the user and then it is broadcast to the Stacks blockchain as explained in the [transaction signing tutorial](/build-apps/transaction-signing).

Note how the arguments are created using `bufferCVFromString`. There are similar methods for all other Clarity types, like `uintCV` or `trueCV`. See the [documentation](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js/tree/master/packages/transactions#constructing-clarity-values) of the stacks-transactions library for more details.

### Step 3: Integrate the component in the app

To use the `PublicUrlRegistrar` component, open `Sharer.jsx` and add the following lines after the `Copy Link` text component of the `Sharer` component:

```js
// src/components/Sharer.jsx
<PublicUrlRegistrar userSession={userSession} />
```

Now, you should be able to register your public to-dos list on the blockchain when you click on "Register on-chain."

![How to register the public to-dos list](/img/todos-register-on-chain.png)

## Waiting for transactions

The method `doContractCall` has a callback `onFinish` that is called after the user confirmed the transaction. This does not mean that the blockchain has accepted and included the transaction on the blockchain. It just means that the transaction was broadcasted to the network. The transaction id is returned in the `onFinish` callback as `data.txId`. This id can be used to find the transaction and its processing status on the blockchain. The [Stack Blockchain API client library](https://hirosystems.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/client/index.html) provides a convenient method to subscribe to the progress using web sockets.

### Step 1: Add dependency

Add the Stacks Blockchain API client library to `package.json` in the root folder of the to-dos list app:

```bash
npm add @stacks/blockchain-api-client
```

### Step 2: Store the transaction ID

Create a react state variable in the `PublicUrlRegistrar` component that holds the transaction id.

```js
// src/components/PublicUrlRegistrar.jsx

const [txId, setTxId] = useState();
```

and set the value in the `onFinish` callback

```js
// src/components/PublicUrlRegistrar.jsx

onFinish: data => {
    console.log(data);
    setTxId(data.txId);
    },
```

### Step 3: Connect to web socket

Add an import for `connectWebSocketClient`:

```js
import { connectWebSocketClient } from "@stacks/blockchain-api-client";
```

Then subscribe for updates of the transaction status by creating a web socket client using `connectWebSocketClient`. Add a call to `client.subscribeTxUpdates` with the transaction id `txId` and a callback function. This callback function is called whenever the transaction status changes. The subscribe process needs to be done only once at the start of the app. Therefore, add it into an effect hook that only depends on the `txId`.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  let sub;
  const subscribe = async (txId) => {
    const client = await connectWebSocketClient(
      "ws://stacks-node-api.blockstack.org/"
    );
    sub = await client.subscribeTxUpdates(txId, (update) => {
      console.log(update);
    });
    console.log({ client, sub });
  };
  subscribe(txId);
}, [txId]);
```

You will see update logs in the console. The received object is a transaction status object and has a `tx_status` property. If the status is `success` the transaction was processed and added to the blockchain.

## Reading the registration details

Now that the transaction was processed successfully, you can read information about a transaction, in particular, the registry id that was returned by the transaction. The id (`registry-id`) is an unsigned integer.

```clarity
(define-public (register ...)
  ...
 (ok registry-id)
)
```

This information should be shown in a new `Transaction` component using the `TransactionsApi` object provided by the client library.

### Step 1: Create a component representing the register transaction

Create a new file `Transaction.jsx` in folder `src/components` and add the following lines:

```jsx
import React, { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Text } from "@blockstack/ui";
import { TransactionsApi } from "@stacks/blockchain-api-client";

export const Transaction = ({ txId }) => {
  const [transactionDetails, setTransactionDetails] = useState();

  const fetchTransactionDetails = useCallback(async () => {
    // fetch transaction from api
  }, [txId]);

  useEffect(() => {
    void fetchTransactionDetails();
  }, [fetchTransactionDetails]);

  return transactionDetails ? (
    <Text fontWeight="500" display="block" mb={0} fontSize={2}>
      Registration: TODO
    </Text>
  ) : null;
};
```

### Step 2: Use TransactionsApi

Information about transactions can be retrieved using the `TransactionsApi` object. Add a definition to the top of the `Transaction.jsx` file:

```js
const transcationsApi = new TransactionsApi();
```

:::note

The constructor takes a configuration argument. It can be used to set the server URL. By default, it is the URL for the node hosted by Hiro PBC.

:::

Then in the `fetchTransactionDetails` method add a call to `getTransactionById`. The result is detailed data about the transaction: the status, when it was created, the type, the contract call details, the transaction result and many more.

```js
// fetch transaction from api
if (txId) {
  const txDetails = await transcationsApi.getTransactionById({ txId });
  setTransactionDetails(txDetails);
}
```

### Step 3: Display transaction details

The text of the transaction details can now be updated with real data. Replace the "TODO" with some result data. For now, let's just show the JSON. Handling Clarity values properly is show in the next section.

```js
<Text fontWeight="500" display="block" mb={0} fontSize={2}>
  Registration: Result {JSON.stringify(transactionDetails.tx_result)}
</Text>
```

### Step 4: Use transaction component

To bring the pieces together, the `Transaction` component should be added to the app. For this, extend the `PublicUrlRegistrar` first so that it can hand over the transaction id when the register transaction was successfully processed.

Add a react state variable `success` after the `txId` state variable

```js
// src/components/PublicUrlRegistrar.jsx
const [success, setSuccess] = useState();
```

and set it to true in the update callback if then transaction update status is `success`

```js
sub = await client.subscribeTxUpdates(txId, (update) => {
  console.log(update);
  setSuccess(update.tx_status === "success");
});
```

Finally, add the `Transaction` component at the end of the `PublicUrlRegistrar` component if the transaction was successfully processed.

```js
{
  success && <Transaction txId={txId} />;
}
```

You should now be able to see an update in the UI if the transaction was successfully added to the blockchain. In real apps, the progress status could be indicated by colors or other UI elements.

## Show recent activities

Similar to the `TransactionApi`, the `AccountsApi` provides easy access to account-related information. The API will be used in this section to show recent activities for the to-dos list registry.

### Step 1: Create recent activities component

Create a new file `RecentActivities.jsx` in folder `src/components` and add the following lines:

```js
import React, { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Text } from "@blockstack/ui";
import { AccountsApi } from "@stacks/blockchain-api-client";
import { CONTRACT_ADDRESS, CONTRACT_NAME } from "../assets/constants";

const accountsApi = new AccountsApi();

export const RecentActivities = () => {
  const [activities, setActivities] = useState();

  const fetchActivities = useCallback(async () => {
    // fetch activities
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    void fetchActivities();
  }, [fetchActivities]);

  console.log({ activities });

  return activities && activities.length > 0 ? (
    <Flex
      display="block"
      position="absolute"
      bottom="0"
      width="100%"
      justifyContent="space-between"
      px={4}
      py={3}
    >
      <Box px={3} background="#efefef">
        <Text fontWeight="500" display="block" mb={0} fontSize={3}>
          Public Todos List Registry
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight="500" display="block" mb={0} fontSize={2}>
          Recent Activities:{" "}
          {activities.map((activity, key) => {
            <Text key={key}>{JSON.stringify(activity)}</Text>;
          })}
        </Text>
      </Box>
    </Flex>
  ) : null;
};
```

Next, add the following line to `Apps.jsx` after the `SignIn` and `TodoList` fragment:

```js
<div className="site-wrapper-inner">
  ...
  <RecentActivities />
</div>
```

### Step 2: Use AccountsApi

Now, add a call to the `getAccountTransactions` method. This method can be used for users and for contracts. It returns transactions that are related to the given account. The default is to return the last 20 transactions.

```js
const fetchActivities = useCallback(async () => {
  // fetch activities
  const response = await accountsApi.getAccountTransactions({
    principal: `${CONTRACT_ADDRESS}.${CONTRACT_NAME}`,
  });
  console.log(response);
}, []);
```

:::info

For users, the principal argument is just the user's stacks address.

:::

### Step 3: Filter for successful contract calls

Contract calls could fail with an error, for example if the public url is too long. The transactions should be filtered for successful contract calls:

```js
const contractCallsOnly = (r) => {
  console.log(r);
  return r.tx_status === "success" && r.tx_type === "contract_call";
};
```

Then apply the filter to the response result and store it in the `activities` variable.
The final callback `fetchActivities` looks like this:

```js
const fetchActivities = useCallback(async () => {
  // fetch activities
  const response = await accountsApi.getAccountTransactions({
    principal: `${CONTRACT_ADDRESS}.${CONTRACT_NAME}`,
  });
  console.log(response);
  setActivities(response.results.filter(contractCallsOnly));
}, []);
```

You should now see a list of hex strings representing the transactions.

![How recent activities as json look](/img/todos-recent-activities-json.png)

### Step 4: Extract registry IDs

For the last step, the returned details need to be decoded and and formatted appropriately to be readable. The `register` function returns the transaction id as a result. As mentioned above, it is an unsigned int (`uint`) encoded as a hex string (`tx_result.hex`) like `0x0100000000000000000000000000000001`. The method `hexToCV` decodes the string and creates a `ClarityValue` object. In this case it is an object of type `UIntCV`.

The client library defines types for all Clarity types. The corresponding type gives access to more properties. For example, `UIntCV` has a `value` property for its number value.

```js
hexToCV(tx_result.hex).value;
```

You can also use `cvToString` for a simple conversion of the `ClarityValue` object to a string

```js
cvToString(hexToCV(tx_result.hex));
```

### Step 5: Display register details

In addition to `tx_result`, the transaction object also contains a timestamp (`burn_block_time_iso`) and a `contract_call` object. The contract call object has properties like the function name (`contract_call.function_name`). Using this, the final representation for `register` transactions should contain the deserialized registry id and the timestamp. It could look like this:

```js
{
  activities.map((activity, key) => {
    if (activity.contract_call.function_name === "register") {
      const result = hexToCV(activity.tx_result.hex.substr(2));
      return (
        <React.Fragment key={key}>
          Entry {result.value.toString()} was registered at{" "}
          {activity.burn_block_time_iso}.{" "}
        </React.Fragment>
      );
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  });
}
```

:::note

The `AccountsApi` and other Api methods provide parameters to page through the results using `limit` and `offset`. See [the docs](https://hirosystems.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/client/interfaces/generated.GetAccountTransactionsRequest.html) for more details.

:::

Congratulations. You just implemented a list of recent activities that was fetched from the blockchain.

![How recent activities look like](/img/todos-recent-activities.png)

## Fetch the first to-dos list

There are two other ways to get state information from the blockchain: read-only functions and data map entries. Read-only functions were already discussed in the [Clarity counter tutorial](/tutorials/clarity-counter). They do not require a transaction to complete. Data maps in Clarity are maps that can be read by any user. See the [Clarity reference](https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#define-map) for more details.

The `todo-registry` contract defines a read-only function `owner-of?` that returns the owner of a registry entry and a data map for details about entries:

```clarity
(define-read-only (owner-of (registration-id uint)) ... )

(define-map registry
  ((registry-id uint))
  (
    (name (buff 30))
    (url (buff 255))
  )
)
```

Let's add the owner information and the details for the first ever registered to-dos list (with `registry-id` 1) to the `RecentActivities` component. The `SmartContractsApi` of the client library provides methods to read these data from the blockchain.

### Step 1: Add state variable for first registration

At first, add a new state variable `firstRegistration`.

```js
// src/components/RecentActvities.jsx

const [firstRegistration, setFirstRegistration] = useState();
```

Then, define a new callback `fetchRegistration` that will contain the calls to the blockchain and update the state variable. Add the following code after the `fetchRegistration` callback and update the effect hook.

```js
const fetchRegistration = useCallback(async () => {
  // fetch newest registration
  // fetch owner
  // fetch public URL and name
});

useEffect(() => {
  void Promise.all([fetchActivities(), fetchRegistration()]);
}, [fetchActivities, fetchRegistration]);
```

### Step 2: Query owner of the first to-dos list

To query the read-only functions of the smart contract, a `SmartContractsApi` object needs to be created, in the same way as the `AccountsApi` object.

```js
const smartContractsApi = new SmartContractsApi();
```

Use that api object in the `fetchRegistration` callback to call the read-only method `owner-of?` like this:

```js
const fetchRegistration = useCallback(async () => {
  const ownerResponse = await smartContractsApi.callReadOnlyFunction({
    contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
    functionName: "owner-of?",
    readOnlyFunctionArgs: ReadOnlyFunctionArgsFromJSON({
      sender: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      arguments: [cvToHex(uintCV(1))],
    }),
  });
  console.log(ownerResponse);
});
```

The arguments of the read-only function are provided as an array of hex encoded `ClarityValue`s.
The helper method `cvToHex` converts a `ClarityValue` into a hex encoded string. It is the reverse function of `hexToCV` that was used to decode the transaction response.
The `sender` can be any stacks address and is not relevant for the `owner-of?` function.

### Step 3: Deserialize the response

A read-only function call returns a response object with an `okay` property and it's `true`, it contains a `result` property with the hex encoded Clarity value. Otherwise the `cause` property describes the error. The helper methods `hexToCV` is used again to decode the result. The result is an optional address of type `SomeCV`. It has a property `value` that contains the owner address. Using `cvToString` with `ownerCV.value` returns the address as a string:

```js
if (ownerResponse.okay) {
  const ownerCV = hexToCV(ownerResponse.result);
  const owner = cvToString(ownerCV.value);
}
```

### Step 4: Fetch a map entry

For the registry details, the data map `registry` of the contract can be queried to receive the username and the registered url. The method `SmartContractsApi.getDataMapEntry` method expects a hex encoded string representing the key. The map key always consists of a Clarity tuple. For the `registry` map, the only value of the tuple is the `registry-id`. Therefore, the hex string is created like this:

```js
const key = cvToHex(tupleCV({ "registry-id": uintCV(1) }));
```

With the encoded key, add the following lines to the `fetchRegistry` callback

```js
const mapEntryResponse = await smartContractsApi.getContractDataMapEntry({
  contractAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  contractName: CONTRACT_NAME,
  mapName: "registry",
  key,
});
console.log({ mapEntryResponse });
```

### Step 5: Deserialized data map entry

The response object has a property `data` that contains the hex encoded result. If the key was invalid the result is an object of type `OptionalNone`. Otherwise, the result is of type `OptionalSome` and its `value` property contains the map entry. It is always a tuple (type `TupleCV`). Its `data` property contains the registered name and public url as `ClarityValue`s.

Therefore the deserialization of the result looks like this:

```js
const optionalMapEntry = hexToCV(mapEntryResponse.data);

if (optionalMapEntry.type === ClarityType.OptionalSome) {
  const mapEntryCV = optionalMapEntry.value;
  const registryData = mapEntryCV.data;
}
```

Add this to the `fetchRegistry` callback and then update the react state variable with all the gathered data. Instead of using `cvToString` you can also access the buffer value directly and convert it to a string. This is useful for the `url` because `cvToString` put the string in quotes.

```js
setFirstRegistration({
  owner,
  name: cvToString(registryData.name),
  url: registryData.url.buffer.toString(),
});
```

### Step 6: Display registry entry

Update the UI to display the data of the first registry entry.

```jsx
{
  firstRegistration && (
    <>
      <Text fontWeight="500" display="block" mb={0} fontSize={0}>
        First registration in 'Public Todos List registry' by
      </Text>
      <Text fontSize={2}>
        <a href={firstRegistration.url}>{firstRegistration.name}</a>{" "}
      </Text>
      <Text fontSize={0}>using address {firstRegistration.owner}</Text>
      <br />
    </>
  );
}
```

Congratulations. You just called read-only functions and map entries from the public registry, without managing a server.

With the completion of this tutorial, you:

- Observed the progress of transaction processing
- Consumed APIs to show recent transactions, data map entries and read-only functions
- Experienced serializing and de-serializing Clarity values

The full source code and smart contract code for the public registry is available at [blockstack-todo-registry](https://github.com/friedger/blockstack-todos).
