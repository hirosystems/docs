![What you'll be studying in this tutorial](/img/todos-home.png)

In this tutorial, you will learn about Stacks authentication and storage by installing,
running, and reviewing the code for a "To-dos" app built with Stacks authentication and storage.

This app highlights the following platform capabilities:

- Generate _Secret Key_ with associated BNS username to authenticate app
- Add, edit and delete encrypted app data with Gaia
- Decrypt data on Gaia for public sharing by URL
- De-authenticate and re-authenticate app with _Secret Key_

[Try the app](https://todos-lovat.vercel.app/) or [view its code on GitHub](https://github.com/hirosystems/todos).

Existing familiarity with [React](https://reactjs.org/) is recommended for reviewing this app's code.

<NodeLTS/>

### Step 1: Install the code and its dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hirosystems/todos && cd todos
npm install
```

### Step 2: Run the app:

```bash
npm run start
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
Compiled successfully

You can now view to-dos in the browser.

    http://localhost:3000/

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build.
```

### Step 3: Review local build

You should see the app's landing page:

## Onboard into your first Stacks app

### Step 1: Choose **Get started** to start onboarding into the app.

The app displays a standardized introductory modal using the `@stacks/connect` library.

![Modal displayed by showConnect function](/img/todos-get-started.png)

This modal is displayed using the `authenticate` function exported by the `src/auth.js` module, which organizes all Stacks resources needed for authentication in the app:

```js
// src/auth.js

import { AppConfig, UserSession, showConnect } from '@stacks/connect';
import { Person } from '@stacks/profile';

const appConfig = new AppConfig(['store_write', 'publish_data']);

export const userSession = new UserSession({ appConfig });

export function authenticate() {
  showConnect({
    appDetails: {
      name: 'Todos',
      icon: window.location.origin + '/logo.svg',
    },
    redirectTo: '/',
    finished: () => {
      window.location.reload();
    },
    userSession: userSession,
  });
}

export function getUserData() {
  return userSession.loadUserData();
}

export function getPerson() {
  return new Person(getUserData().profile);
}
```

The `authenticate` function implements the `showConnect` function imported from the `connect` package of Stacks.js.

`showConnect` triggers the display of a modal that initiates the authentication process for users, one in which they'll authenticate with a _Secret Key_ that's used to encrypt their private data.

The `showConnect` function accepts a number of properties within a parameter object such as:

- The app's `name` and `icon`: provided as strings comprising the `appDetails` object property.
- The `redirectTo` string: used to provide a URL to which the user should be redirected upon successful authentication. The `onFinish` callback serves a similar purpose by handling successful authentication within a context of a popup window.
- The `userSession` object: used to pass the [scopes](/build-apps/authentication#initiate-usersession-object) needed by the app.

Note how the `userSession` object is created at the beginning of this module by leveraging an `AppConfig` object that's first initiated with all relevant scopes.

The [`UserSession`](https://stacks.js.org/classes/auth.UserSession.html) and [`AppConfig`](https://stacks.js.org/classes/auth.AppConfig.html) classes are themselves imported from the `@stacks/auth` library.

In the separate `src/components/App.jsx` component, you can see how
`componentDidMount` loads the user's data into the app's state, whether upon redirect post-authentication with `userSession.handlePendingSignIn()` or upon detection of an existing session with `userSession.isUserSignedIn()`:

```jsx
// src/components/App.jsx

import { userSession } from '../auth';

...

componentDidMount() {
  if (userSession.isSignInPending()) {
    userSession.handlePendingSignIn().then((userData) => {
      window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, "/")
      this.setState({ userData: userData})
    });
  } else if (userSession.isUserSignedIn()) {
    this.setState({ userData: userSession.loadUserData() });
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Choose **Get started** to generate a _Secret Key_.

The app triggers a popup window in which [Stacks Web Wallet](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-wallet-web)
loads from [`app.blockstack.org`](http://app.blockstack.org/) and begins generating a new _Secret Key_.

!["Secret Key generation" screen](/img/todos-secret-key-generation.png)

### Step 3: Choose **Copy Secret Key** to copy your _Secret Key_ to the clipboard.

The _Secret Key_ is a unique 12-word [mnemonic phrase](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Mnemonic_phrase) that
empowers the user not only to access Stacks apps securely and independently. It's also used to encrypt
all of the private data they create and manage with Stacks apps.

_Secret Keys_ are like strong passwords. However, they can never be recovered if lost or reset if stolen.
As such, it's paramount that users handle them with great care.

!["Copy Secret Key" screen](/img/todos-copy-secret-key.png)

### Step 4: Choose **I've saved it** to confirm you've secured your _Secret Key_ in a suitable place.

!["I've saved it" screen](/img/todos-saved-secret-key.png)

### Step 5: Enter a username value and choose **Continue**

The username will be used by the app to generate a URL for sharing your to-dos, should you choose to make them public.

It is registered on the Stacks blockchain with [BNS](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/clarity/noteworthy-contracts/bns-contract) and associated with your _Secret Key_.

!["Choose username" screen](/img/todos-choose-username.png)

### Done: You've now completed onboarding into the app

## Add, edit and delete to-dos privately

Once you've authenticated the app, you can start adding to-dos by entering values into the "Write your to do"
field and hitting "Enter."

!["To-dos" app home screen](/img/todos-home.png)

The data for all to-dos are saved as JSON to the Gaia hub linked to your Secret Key using the [`putFile`](https://stacks.js.org/classes/storage.Storage.html#putFile) method of the `storage` object in the `src/storage.js` module, which manages all data storage for the app:

```js
// src/storage.js

import { userSession } from './auth';
import { Storage } from '@stacks/storage';

const storage = new Storage({ userSession });

...

export const saveTasks = async (userSession, tasks, isPublic) => {
  await storage.putFile(TASKS_FILENAME, JSON.stringify({ tasks, isPublic }), {
    encrypt: !isPublic,
  });
};
```

These to-dos are subsequently loaded using the [`getFile`](https://stacks.js.org/classes/storage.Storage.html#getFile)
method of the same object in the same module:

```js
// src/storage.js

import { userSession } from './auth';
import { Storage } from '@stacks/storage';

const storage = new Storage({ userSession });

...

export const fetchTasks = async (userSession, username) => {
  const tasksJSON = await storage.getFile(TASKS_FILENAME, {
    decrypt: false,
    username: username || undefined,
  });
  ...
};
```

The `storage` object is instantiated with the `Storage` class of the `@stacks/storage` library and `userSession` to ensure that all storage calls are made with the user's Gaia hub.

By default, the `putFile` and `getFile` methods automatically encrypt data when saved and decrypt it when retrieved,
using the user's _Secret Key_. This ensures that only the user has the ability to view this data.

When deleting a todo, the same `putFile` method is used to save a new JSON array of to-dos that excludes the deleted todo.

## Publish your to-dos publicly

Select "Make public" to make your to-dos accessible to the public for sharing via URL.

!["Public to-dos" screen](/img/todos-home-public.png)

This will call `saveTasks` with the `isPublic` parameter set to `true`, which is used to disable encryption when using `putFile`.

The app will now show all of your to-dos to anyone who visits the URL displayed with your Stacks username as a suffix.

## Sign out and see your public tasks

Select "Sign out" to deauthenticate the app with your Stacks account.

This calls the [`signUserOut`](https://stacks.js.org/classes/auth.UserSession.html#signUserOut) method
of the `userSession` object within `src/components/Header.jsx`.

Now visit the URL that was provided to you when you made your tasks public. This URL has the format `/todos/:username`, so if your username were `janedoe.id.blockstack`, the URL would be `localhost:3000/todos/janedoe.id.blockstack`.

When you visit this page, the `TodoList.jsx` component detects that there is a username in the URL.
When there is a username, it calls `fetchTasks`, this time providing the `username` argument. This `username`
option is then passed to `getFile`, which will look up where that user's tasks are stored.

## Sign back in

At this point, you will be logged out from the app but not you'll still have an active session with the Stacks
app itself on [app.blockstack.org](https://app.blockstack.org). Navigate to app.blockstack.org and select "Sign out" there if you want to deauthenticate the Stacks app as well.

Once signed out, select "Sign In" to sign back in with your _Secret Key_.

If you've previously deauthenticated the Stacks app, you'll see a prompt to enter your _Secret Key_:

!["Sign in" screen](/img/todos-sign-in.png)

The preceding screen is omitted if you have an active session with the Stacks app already.

Then you'll be presented with the option to select an existing username associated with your _Secret Key_ or
create a new one if you wish to authenticate the app with a different identity and data set:

!["Choose account" screen](/img/todos-choose-account.png)

You'll now see your to-dos as an authenticated user for the username you've chosen.
