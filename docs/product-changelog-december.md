## **Stacks API**

December saw the addition of Stacks 2.1 support and preparation for activation. While this work was being completed, we continued working on API v7, which will include a number of improvements for Blockchain Naming Support (BNS), Rosetta fixes, and better error handling with new ENV configurations for API shutdown timeouts.

## **Blockchain**

This month, we released an updated [Hiro Archive](https://docs.hiro.so/references/hiro-archive?_gl=1*1369xwy*_ga*NTQ3NDA3NTIuMTY2MDA3MTQ1MA..*_ga_NB2VBT0KY2*MTY3MzU0MDkxMS43MC4wLjE2NzM1NDA5MTEuMC4wLjA.#what-is-the-hiro-archive). The Archive (formerly Hiro Archiver) enables you to download and use any of the published datasets needed to run a Stacks environment. 

The artifacts hosted can be used to quickly spin up a new stacks-blockchain node, or comprehensive stacks-blockchain-api deployment.

## **Clarinet**

In December, the Clarinet team worked to improve Stacks 2.1 support along with devnet stability. They also added the ability to jump to the definition of any function, variable, constant, map, function argument, let variable—pretty much anything you’d might expect—including `contract-call?` to local contract directly from the VS Code extension.

## **Hiro Wallet**

In December, the Wallet team released several new features including adding a “Get Support” button in the app, making it easier to transfer within the same wallet, in addition to tracking the app domain as an event property for all events triggered within the flow.

The current releases are:

- [Web v3.29.0](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-wallet-web/compare/v3.28.0...v3.29.0)
- [Desktop v.4.7.0](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-wallet/releases/tag/v4.7.0)

## *Explorer**

In December, the Explorer team added new features and implemented a pair of bug fixes, while also adding features in the Explorer Sandbox to support list arguments. This also includes the ability to support calling functions from the contract page.

The Explorer page also now shows high level statistics, making it easier for users to quickly find important pieces of information such as STX Supply, Last Block, Current Stacking Cycle, and Next Stacking Cycle.

Finally, the Explorer team implemented a pair of fixes to exclude block info from transactions in microblocks and fixing the colors on dark mode.
