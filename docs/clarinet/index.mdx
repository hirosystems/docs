<p class="p-3 rounded-lg bg-neutral-100 text-neutral-500 dark:bg-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-400">Clarinet is a local development environment that offers everything you need to create and deploy smart contracts on Stacks.</p>

<div class="mb-10"></div>

With Clarinet, you can quickly setup your Clarity project through the command line tool. This covers every stage of the development cycle from generating new contracts, an interactive REPL and validating contracts to deployment on a devnet, testnet or mainnet.
