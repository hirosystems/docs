The example apps provided in this section demonstrate key features of the Stacks blockchain, including connecting to the wallet, reading on-chain values, creating transactions, and interacting with the web wallet.

You can use the example apps provided here as a basis for your own Stacks app, or just as a reference for how Hirodevelopers implement specific features.

- [To-dos](/example-apps/to-dos): A to-do list app that demonstrates authentication with the web wallet and storing data off-chain with Gaia.
- [Public registry](/example-apps/public-registry): A extension of the to-do list that makes your list public through a Clarity smart contract.
- [Billboard](/example-apps/billboard): An app that stores a simple message on the blockchain and allows you to view it. Demonstrates the DevNet local development environment of [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet).
- [Heystack](/example-apps/heystack): A public chat app featuring a comprehensive demonstraction of the web wallet, Clarity smart contracts, and the Stacks API.
