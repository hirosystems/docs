## What's New

> **_NOTE:_**
>
> The `/extended/v2/*` endpoints represent the modern API that is being continually expanded to support the Nakamoto upgrade. We encourage developers to use v2 endpoints for new developments. Be aware that `/extended/v1/*` are the older set of endpoints. Though they continue to function alongside v2, be advised that they will be deprecated in the coming months.

### New Testnet URL

`https://api.nakamoto.testnet.hiro.so`

### Nakamoto endpoints

The Stacks Blockchain API has a series of new endpoints to support the upcoming Nakamoto upgrade:

-  Get Proof-of-Transfer details per Cycle including Signers and Stackers, with information about stacked STX amounts, payout addresses and signer weights
-  Get a list of Stacks blocks per Bitcoin block to support the new Nakamoto mining mechanism
-  Get all transactions relevant to a STX address or Contract ID including filters for FT and NFT transfers
-  Support for the new Nakamoto `tenure_change` transaction type across all our transaction endpoints
-  Get a summary of current network mempool transaction fees, including statistics for expected confirmation priorities
-  Get the deployment status of multiple smart contracts in one call

All of these endpoints are backwards compatible with Stacks nodes running version 2.4 or earlier

### Event Replay optimizations

-  Optimize replay speed by creating a new parquet-based ingestion that optimizes for canonical chain information
-  Optimize classic TSV event replay by improving block ingestion times

### New transaction type `tenure_change`

Affects endpoints:

-  `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/transactions`
-  `/extended/v1/tx`
-  `/extended/v1/tx/{tx_id}`
-  `/extended/v1/tx/{tx_id}/raw`
-  `/extended/v1/tx/mempool`
-  `/extended/v1/tx/multiple`

### New endpoints: `/extended/v2/*`

/extended/v1 vs /extended/v2 endpoints: Key Difference
The ﻿/extended/v2/* endpoints represent the modern API that is being continually expanded to support the Nakamoto upgrade. We encourage developers to use v2 endpoints for new developments. Be aware that ﻿/extended/v1/* are the older set of endpoints. Though they continue to function alongside v2, be advised that they will be deprecated in the coming months.

-  `/extended/v2/mempool/fees`
-  `/extended/v2/burn-blocks`
-  `/extended/v2/burn-blocks/{height_or_hash}`
-  `/extended/v2/burn-blocks/{height_or_hash}/blocks`
-  `/extended/v2/blocks`
-  `/extended/v2/blocks/{height_or_hash}`
-  `/extended/v2/blocks/{height_or_hash}/transactions`
-  `/extended/v2/addresses/{address}/transactions:`
-  `/extended/v2/addresses/{address}/transactions/{tx_id}/events:`
-  `/extended/v2/smart-contracts/status`
-  `/extended/v2/pox/cycles`
-  `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}`
-  `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}/signers`
-  `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}/signers/{signer_key}`
-  `/extended/v2/pox/cycles/{cycle_number}/signers/{signer_key}/stackers`

### Deprecated endpoints

-  `/extended/v1/block`
-  `/extended/v1/block/{hash}`
-  `/extended/v1/block/by_height/{height}`
-  `/extended/v1/block/by_burn_block_hash/{burn_block_hash}`
-  `/extended/v1/block/by_burn_block_height/{burn_block_height}`
-  `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/transactions`
-  `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/{tx_id}/with_transfers`
-  `/extended/v1/address/{principal}/transactions_with_transfers`
-  `/extended/v1/fee_rate`
-  `/extended/v1/tx/block/{block_hash}`
-  `/extended/v1/tx/block_height/{height}`
