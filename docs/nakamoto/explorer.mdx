## What's New

### Introducing a Fresh View for Blocks

The Stacks Explorer now features a new way to display blocks, aligning with the Nakamoto upgrade's approach of multiple STX blocks settling into one BTC block.

### Tailored Viewing Experience

This new view is available on [Nakamoto Testnet](https://explorer.hiro.so/?chain=testnet&api=https://api.nakamoto.testnet.hiro.so), accessible via the Network dropdown.

#### Two Distinctive Display Modes

1. **Independent Display:** Focuses on STX blocks progress.
2. **COMING SOON: Grouped by Bitcoin Block:** Shows BTC blocks flow alongside STX blocks.
