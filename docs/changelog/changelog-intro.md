## Overview

Each month, Hiro publishes a [Release Roundup](https://www.hiro.so/blog-categories/product) blog post on the Hiro website that provides detailed information about significant product changes and updates that were made to the different Hiro products in a specific month. This information is aggregated and collected by the various Hiro Engineering teams after each new feature is released and becomes generally available to ensure users remain up-to-date with any changes and updates.
