## Purpose

We want to encourage developers to focus on shipping their business models to Stacks blockchain, ship often and happily, and avoid getting caught up with unboxing and infrastructure overhead.

To deliver developer productivity, the Hiro Platform comes pre-installed with the following developer tools and resources to help speed up the developer journey:

- VS Code in Web Browser
- Clarinet
- Clarity for VS Code
- Clarity Examples

These tools enable you to quickly get up and running with the Platform without requiring additional steps. Less setup time equals more time for translating your business models into code, testing them, and deploying them to a Stacks network!

:::note

While using the BETA release of the Hiro Platform, Hiro will **not** be liable for any data loss as described in the [Terms of Service](http://hiro.so/terms).
