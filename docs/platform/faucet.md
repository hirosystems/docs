2. **Login into Your Wallet**: Log into the platform with the wallet that has the test account that you want funded. Click _Connect Wallet_ to login.
3. **Request Tokens**: You'll find a straightforward interface with a button to request tokens. Simply click on the button _Request STX_.
4. **Receive 500 STX Tokens**: By clicking the button, you'll receive 500 STX tokens to your testnet account.

### Note:

- **Daily Limit**: To ensure fair distribution and availability for all developers, there's a limit of one request per day. Plan your testing accordingly!
