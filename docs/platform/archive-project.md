Sometimes, you may find it necessary to archive a project from your project list. It is important to understand archiving a project is not the same as deleting a project. Archiving a project means you wish to move the project status from an active project to one that is not active and visible in your project list.

## Archive a project

Follow the steps below to archive a project:

1. Use your credentials to sign in to the [Hiro Platform](https://platform.hiro.so/).
2. Once you are authenticated and taken to the Project page, you will see a list of your projects.
3. Select the project you wish to archive from the project list.
4. Click on the far-right three dots and select Archive. This removes your project from the project list and places it into an archive folder.

## Unarchive a project

Follow the steps below to unarchive a project:

1. On the [projects page](https://platform.hiro.so/projects), if you wish you unarchive a project, select the *Archive* button at the top and select the far-right three dots and select *Unarchive*.
2. Once the project is unarchived, you should see that project listed on the [projects page](https://platform.hiro.so/projects).
