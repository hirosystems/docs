This article walks you through the deployment process of your project. Once you have your clarity contracts ready for your project, you can deploy the project easily using the Hiro Platform.

## Prerequisites

- Follow the [getting started](getting-started.md) guide to sign in to the Hiro Platform.
- Follow the [create project](create-project.md) guide to create or import a project.
- Make sure you have [installed and connected to your wallet](https://wallet.hiro.so/) to deploy your contracts.
- Follow the [build contract](build-contract.md) guide to create or customize your smart contracts before you can deploy them.

## Use the deploy button

Once you have your smart contracts ready, you can deploy them to mainnet/testnet environments using the **Deploy** button on the Hiro Platform.

The following are the steps to deploy your contracts using the **Deploy** button.

1. On the [projects page](https://platform.hiro.so/projects), select the project you want to deploy to the blockchain.
2. Then, in the list of the contracts displayed for the project, select the contract you are ready to deploy.
3. Use the *Deploy* button available on the right side of the contract.
4. Choose the environment to deploy - *Deploy to Testnet* or *Deploy to Mainnet*.
