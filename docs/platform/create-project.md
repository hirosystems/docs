## Create new Project

To create a new project, you can start with a *Blank project* or use one of the examples displayed in the project modal - Hello world, Ordyswap, Clarity bitcoin, Counter, Fungible token, Lightning swaps, NFT marketplace, Non-fungible token. You can also refer to the examples in the [Clarity examples](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-examples/tree/main/examples) to view the source code.

Once you select a new project from the list, the selected example project will be automatically cloned and displayed on the [projects](https://platform.hiro.so) page. Below is the screenshot of the *Hello world* project.

Now, you can view your projects on the [projects page](https://platform.hiro.so). Select the project to review the list of contracts in them. 

## Import Project from GitHub

When you **Import from GitHub**, there will be a modal displayed on the right to enter the GitHub URL of your project.
