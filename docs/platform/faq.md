### **Clarinet Integrate/Devnet is not working in terminal**

This feature is in the roadmap. It is coming up soon.

### **I cannot import my project**

Max project size allowed for imports is 50MB, so check the size before importing.

### **I cannot download files from terminal**

Internet access is unavailable inside VS Code and Terminal.

### **Where do I log issues/bugs?**

Use the [feedback widget inside Hiro Platform](https://hiro-pbc.canny.io/hiro-platform) or go directly to [https://hiro-pbc.canny.io/hiro-platform](https://hiro-pbc.canny.io/hiro-platform) to report issues.

### **Are my projects and contracts isolated?**

Your projects are deployed as pods in Kubernetes. Each pod operates with strict security context and resource limits. You are the only one to have access to the secured usage data.

### **I see an error: 'Unable to retrieve contract ...' in the browser console. How do I resolve it?**

Currently, "clarinet integrate", "requirements" and "deployment plans" aren't supported in Clarinet installed in Hiro Platform. These are on the roadmap.

### **Can I use deployment plans?**

We are in the process of building the support for deployment plans in the Hiro Platform.
