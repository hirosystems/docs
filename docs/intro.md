Hiro is a developer tools company that supports developers to build Apps running on the Stacks blockchain.

Apps built on Stacks typically consist of a Clarity smart contract for handling on-chain data and a JavaScript frontend on the web. Trustless data storage is also available through Gaia, a decentralized storage option for storing large amounts of app or user data off-chain.

The developer documentation on this site provides information about using Hiro products to build applications on the Stacks blockchain. The examples and tutorials available cover all phases of app development, from smart contracts to frontend. Hiro's developer tools allow you to rapidly iterate on an app locally, develop comprehensive unit tests, and deploy your app to the live Stacks chain.

If you are interested in general information about Stacks, including information on the STX token, mining, and learning the Clarity smart contract language, see the [official Stacks documentation](https://docs.stacks.co/).
